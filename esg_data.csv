105,1646636037.0,Will the United States become energy independent?,"A growing question politicians and economists are starting to ask themselves, will the United States become energy independent? With the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the US has sanctioned Russia and is determining whether or to impose tougher restrictions on the Russian energy sector, such as ban Russian oil imports.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki outlined a range of efforts to increase production of natural gas and oil, but conceded that ""domestic production has not insulated us from the price volatility of fossil fuels or the whims of those who control them, such as President Putin. Americans know that."" She stated ""The only way to protect US over the long term is to become energy independent"".

So, this isn't just a concentration on becoming energy independent; it is a focus to reduce the dependency on Russian fossil fuels while still focusing on clean energy to help mitigate global warming.

Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse told reporters at a Friday press briefing, ""We are looking at options that we can take right now, if we were to cut the US consumption of Russian energy"". I believe the only way to become energy independent and still focus on mitigating global warming is to make huge advances in the clean and renewable energy sector.

So, with that being said, do you think the US will become energy independent? And if yes, what petroleum companies look good right now? What clean and renewable energy companies out there do you think will have the upper hand on receiving government grants to help the US succeed in this endeavor?",Reddit
106,1621783291.0,Who are the players in energy grid storage?,"Hi everyone.

With the increase of renewable energy power systems are gonna face an interesting problem: negative price. 

Negative price is the situation where there is a non flexible demand and a strong non flexible offer. 

In other words, it is becoming very common situation in which the production from renewable is high and at the same time conventional resources like nuclear power or gas power are kept on because the cost of temporary shutting down plants is costly.

108,1699728402.0,Has anyone invested through Serge Energy? Need tips - Offer seems too good to be true,"Hey everyone,

Roughly two years ago I found a really nice investment opportunity (guaranteed minimum 10% annual ROI over the course of 5 years) in wooden pellets through Serge Energy, a company based in Finland. 

I was a bit skeptical, so I did a ton of googling around and decided  to eventually go for it.

The amount I invested was fairly small, lets say 5k.

Over the last two years, everything has seemed fine and normal. 

My account manager calls me every couple of months (6-10) to let me know how the market prices are, considering the price of pellets started spiking due to the invasion of Ukraine.

I received a few emails with additional investment opportunities, most of them with a ROI of 12-15% per year, but it didn't really seem anything out of the ordinary considering the price of pellets had been soaring so fast that those values were still below the selling market value.

I received an invitation to a event in Helsinki, at the HQ, regarding future investment opportunities (I didn't go, but it all seemed fine).

Roughly a week ago I received a more curious email. Not from my account manager, but from two Asset Growth Executives (their title in the signature of the email).

The email basically states that they found a number of birch trees on my patch of land (the one used to produce wooden pellets) and that this is a great financial turn, since these can be turned into sheets of Veneer which will be sold for roughly 5x my initial investment and the payout of this process will be in 3 months from now. And the process of pellets will keep running, but the payout will be delayed a year.

For this to go forward, I would need to do an additional payment of roughly 40% the initial investment value (which, once again, is a fairly low value), to pay for the processing fees of the third party company who handles the wood. Serge Energy would also keep their usual 10% of the sale price of the veneer sheets.

So, in short, is this legit? 

Everything I google regarding the company comes out as being legit and I was fairly confident they were legit up until now -- since this really seems too good to be true.

Any feedbacks anyone?

Thanks in advance.",Reddit
109,1758797151.0,Potential Ukraine peace push? Impact on energy markets if Russia is pressured to negotiate,"Zelensky recently claimed that Trump promised to “consider” providing Ukraine with weapons that could force Putin to the negotiating table.

If such a scenario plays out, the market implications could be huge especially for energy.

Oil & Gas: Russia remains a major supplier globally despite sanctions. A credible peace push could ease fears of supply disruptions and potentially bring more Russian crude/natural gas back into legitimate global channels. On the flip side, if escalation happens before talks, we could see another spike in Brent/WTI.

Europe: European natural gas prices have been extremely sensitive to the war. A genuine move toward peace could stabilize or even depress prices, but if the path is rocky, volatility might remain high. LNG exporters in the U.S. (LNG, CQP) could be impacted if Europe shifts away from emergency buying.

Energy Stocks: Majors like XOM, CVX, Shell, BP might see headwinds if peace reduces the risk premium baked into energy markets. On the other hand, stability could boost refining margins and long-term demand planning.

Broader Commodities: If peace looks real, agricultural and fertilizer markets might calm (Ukraine/Russia being key wheat & potash exporters). That could ease global inflation pressures.",Reddit

112,1655072741.0,"Stagflation was about energy price, not monetary policy.","Before you read any of my words, [look closely at this graph](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart). Note that it is in today’s prices (e.g. adjusted for inflation). Before even looking at the 1970’s, look at the 50’s and 60’s. Each decade brought new incremental lows to the price of oil, and society was designed around the premise of cheap oil, from travel to manufacturing to home heating. Little effort was made on efficiency, because for almost 3 decades oil got progressively cheaper each year. Like a Thanksgiving turkey, the American economy loved the farmer that fed it from December to November.

Now we come to stagflation. Oil went from $28 a barrel in December 1973 to  $63 in January of 1974 - just a month later. The historical high price of oil was $32 in 1948. To put this in modern terms, it would be like oil hitting $300 a barrel by mid-July from $120 now. This energy shock is what caused the twin pillagers of economic stagnation (they laid me off!) and inflation (it costs me how much to fill up my tank?). The problem was not bad monetary policy in 1973. I mean, it might have been bad, but  it didn’t matter much at all compared to the overnight explosion of prices in the necessary commodity that underpinned the global economy, from food to airplanes. I really must emphasize the food point, without tractors and gas we can’t feed 98% of the world with only 2% working the fields. Minus fossil fuels, that ratio flips - you need 98% of the population farming to feed the lucky 2% who can have a different job. That’s what made the medieval era different. 

Why did oil skyrocket like that? [Because America’s support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war of 1973 led to the OPEC oil embargo](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/oil-shock-of-1973-74). As we are learning now, if an oil cartel decides to pick a side in a war, they can take a pound of flesh. Though Russia is only a fraction as dominant now as OPEC was then. 

I’ve seen folks debating whether Volker’s deflationary and merciless interest rate hikes helped lower demand enough. I’ve seen folks suggest Reagan’s inflationary and optimistic tax cuts somehow voodooed the economic back into shape. Both are efforts to paint the target on top of the bullet holes already in the wall. Oil peaked in May of 1980 and dropped off a cliff in January 1986*. The reason for that collapse? [Saudi Arabia wanted to take more market share and increased production](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1986/06/1986b_bpea_gately_adelman_griffin.pdf). The lesson of stagflation isn’t some cautionary tale about monetary policy. It’s about the price of energy, full stop. Preventing Volker or Reagan had anything to do with it more than on the margins is just an exercise in comfort - it’s nice to think that we can choose leaders who might fix something. In reality they are all riding the same elephant, and they aren’t the ones telling it what to do. Some, however, do a better job of convincing others that they are in charge. 

The one thing we could (and did) meaningfully do that was in our control was reduce waste - double pane windows to keep heat inside in winter, smarter manufacturing processes, more fuel efficient cares, etc. The decline in price from 1980 to 1986 was the product of getting smarter about energy use. Saudi Arabia just saw the writing on the wall and decided to grab market share while it could. It was in their interest to encourage uncritical oil consumption long term. 

Any news article or comment you see that brings up the dreaded specter of stagflation had better provide a reason for why we change-point jump into a new energy pricing regime, because that’s what it takes. Be as pessimistic or optimistic as you’re intuition allows about what’s coming, but it’s important to know the history of stagflation given how much it’s coming up. And that history is basically: you are in less control than you think you are. 

Now, with all that in mind, scroll down to the [third graph on this page](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth). This (long term, not short term) is the most important thing happening right now, just like the OPEC embargo was the most important thing happening during stagflation. The cheaper energy is, the less we have to think about it, and the more we can think about computers, social networks, graphics cards, AI, EVs, etc. The fun economy starts after the “eat your vegetables” economy of energy price ends.

A pellet of uranium, the size of a finger nail, can create the same amount of energy as 1 ton of coal, or 150 gallons of oil. (Roughly 1 MWh of electricity) 

The nuclear lifecycle creates minimal carbon emissions. And it’s 0 carbon emissions while actually producing the electricity. All of the carbon emissions come from mining, fuel processing, construction, and waste management. It’s on par with wind energy for lifecycle emissions without the drawback of being an intermittent form of energy. 

For some context here, nuclear energy produces 3-15 gCO2/kWh across the lifecycle while natural gas produces 400-500 gCO2/kWh. 

An unfortunate realization I’ve come to regarding the performance of nuclear energy stocks is that they’re heavily dependent on the performance of tech companies, specifically AI. Friday and today saw widespread declines across nuclear energy stocks because Microsoft noted less demand than they originally thought for new data centers.

I’ve been reading up on companies like $LEU, $SMR, $CEG, and $NNE, trying to understand how they fit into the broader push for clean energy and long-term demand. Curious what others here think about this sector, the outlook for nuclear as part of the energy transition, and whether you’re watching any other stocks in this space.

With the current macro backdrop - surging electricity demand from AI and data centers, governments pushing nuclear expansion, and supply chain bottlenecks in uranium, and whatever effect the tarrif stuff might have - I’m curious how others see nuclear positioning. Does it stand to outperform other clean energy plays, or are cost and permitting still the bigger risks?


Always appreciate hearing different DD angles and experiences as I continue researching this. Thanks!

• The House just green-lit Trump’s 1,100-page tax-and-spend monster by a single vote. CBO says +$3.8 T to the deficit over 10 yrs.
• Moody’s already yanked the last AAA last week; today’s vote pours gasoline on the fire.

• Dollar slips, gold +1 %, Bitcoin at ATH $111 k. Solar/green names crater as subsidies face the axe.

Why it matters:

1. Higher term premium → equities must re-rate; every 25 bp ≈ 3–4 % valuation hit on long-duration tech.


2. Curve steepening punishes everything financed “long-short” (think private credit, CRE).


3. If Senate trims the bill, relief rally; if not, brace for more forced selling of Treasuries by overseas reserve managers.

124,1612987259.0,I am no longer picking stocks. It's ETFs for me.,"I've been investing for a couple years. Most of my stock picks have been large cap companies, lots of tech and consumer products. I follow trends, buy the dip, yadda yadda.

About a year ago I started putting extra money into ETFs. For those, I have focused on tech heavy funds, clean energy, next gen stuff- all Vanguard or low cost funds. Now that my portfolio is split evenly between individual stocks and ETFs, I've noticed a surprising trend:

My ETFs beat my stock picks almost every day. Today is a great example- in a mixed market, my individual stocks are (collectively) down -$195, but my ETFs are (collectively) up $110. And it is like this fairly consistently. On a good day for the markets as a whole, my ETFs are always beating my stock picks. Sure, there are times I have an individual stock that might pop and outperform my ETFs, but more regularly, my collective stock picks rarely outperform my collection of ETF picks.

I guess I am just saying that I am done trying to pick the next winning stock, spending my valuable time pouring over charts and digging through the news for rumors. I am liquidating my individual stocks and dumping it all back into my ETF picks at the next market dip.

[edit] SO MANY PEOPLE asking what my ETF picks are. I am not a financial expert, so I don't claim that these are the best, but I have: VGT QQQJ VOO SCHA ARKK and VBIX (which is a mutual fund, not an ETF).

I plan to start investing for retirement soon after I purchase my house and have a stable amount of savings.

I have been thinking recently about how the usage of AI and Data Centers are causing a current energy shortage nationwide, and how our need for energy is going to be ever greater.

I think the energy sector will boom based upon this need and a growing population. Specifically nuclear energy as that is making a resurgence due to cleared misunderstandings.

Some other good investment ideas would be energy consulting companies that assist large companies is cutting energy usage for their AI and LLM’s, or even companies that specifically generate power just for large Data centers.

127,1646671137.0,Biden administration is moving ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is willing to move ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports into the United States without the participation of allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

President Joe Biden is expected to hold a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom on Monday as his administration continues to seek their support for a ban on the imports.

The White House is also negotiating with congressional leaders who are working on fast-tracking legislation banning Russian imports, a move that is forcing the administration to work on an expedited timeline, a source told Reuters

**A senior U.S. official told Reuters that no final decision has been made but ""it is likely just the U.S if it happens”**

Oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the United States and European allies consider banning Russian imports.

Europe relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products. read more The United States relies far less on Russian crude and products, but a ban would help drive prices up and pinch U.S. consumers already seeing historic prices at the gas pump. read more

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Sunday letter that her chamber is ""exploring"" legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week $10 billion in aid for Ukraine in response to Moscow's military invasion of its neighbor.

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil. The bill is getting fast-tracked.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russia's refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has never launched.

So far, it has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and U.S. energy prices.

Asked if the United States has ruled out banning Russian oil imports unilaterally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday said: ""I'm not going to rule out taking action one way or another, irrespective of what they do, but everything we've done, the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners,"" Blinken said.

At the same time, the White House did not deny that Biden might make a trip to Saudi Arabia as the United States seeks to get Riyadh to increase energy production. Axios reported that such a trip was a possibility.

""This is premature speculation and no trip is planned,"" a White House official said.

A year ago Biden shifted U.S. policy away from a focus on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is considered by many to be the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85-year-old King Salman.

Inflation accelerated further in May, with prices rising 8.6% from a  year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981, the Bureau of  Labor Statistics reported Friday.

The consumer price index, a  wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more  than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding volatile food and energy  prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9%  estimate.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared to respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.

Surging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.

Energy  prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to  34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain,  pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.

Shelter costs, which account  for about a one-third weighting on the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month,  the fastest one-month gain since March 2004. The 5.5% 12-month gain is  the most since February 1991.

Finally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.

Those  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month.  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though  average hourly earnings rose 0.3%. On a 12-month basis, real average  hourly earnings were down 3%.

Markets reacted negatively to the  report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall  Street and government bond yields rising.

Some of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%).

Friday’s numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.

The  inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a  rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May’s report  likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest  rate increases ahead.

“Obviously, nothing is good in this report,”  said Julian Bridgen, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic  research firm. “There is nothing in there that’s going to give the Fed  any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.”

With  75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets  widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and  possibly into 2023. The central bank’s benchmark short-term borrowing  rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to  2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.

Inflation has been a political headache for the White House and President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).

Administration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to [the Covid pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/), imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services, and [the Russian attack on Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).

In  a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further  improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the  budget deficit.

However, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering  inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that  the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.

How  much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper  with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go  further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current  inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears  because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now.",Reddit

Unlike the 2017/18 rise of Bitcoin, the 2020/21 Bitcoin price action has been largely driven and influenced by institutional demand.

With institutional demand comes institutional products. We have seen bitcoin derivatives, bitcoin trusts, and more recently a new way for exposure to bitcoin price action: publicly traded bitcoin mining companies.

There are two bitcoin mining companies which I'd like to review for you here. Both trade on Nasdaq; they are [**RIOT**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-RIOT/) and [**MARA**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MARA/).

Lets begin with a quick summary on bitcoin mining.

---

## **What is Bitcoin Mining?**

To mine a new block on the bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining). The cryptographic combination of the nonce + next block content must be numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target (more on this below). Generating a new nonce is extremely computationally expensive. There is no shortcut, miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result. They are trying to find the answer to a math problem; a nonce that hashes correctly with the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) (cryptographical hashing function).

The bitcoin network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks. This is called the [difficulty](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty). The aim is to have a new block mined approximately every 10 minutes. This means that if the mining power is doubled, the difficulty is made 2x harder. Double the energy for the same amount of bitcoin.

We can see an estimate for the [total hash rate being applied to the bitcoin network today](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate).  Notice that it is about 150m TH/s right now (150 million trillion nonces tried every second). So for every block (every 10 minutes) 9*10^22 attempts are done (90 sextillion) until one lucky participant finds a valid nonce and can ""mine"" the next bitcoin block. In doing so they get rewarded 6.25 newly generated bitcoin + some bitcoin in transaction fees from users of the network.

You can run code on your computer to try and find the next bitcoin block. In fact, this is how all bitcoin mining used to be done. However, these days you will end up spending more on electricity than you mine in bitcoin. This is because people have developed special ASIC chips designed specially for brute forcing the SHA-256 function. These chips are a factor of 100 times more efficient than your computer.

## **Mining on an ASIC Bitcoin Miner**

The biggest producer of ASIC Bitcoin Miners is a Chinese company called [Bitmain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmain). They produce miners, run many of the miners, and even run many [mining pools](https://antpool.com/) where people can collectively search for the next block and split the profits.

Bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in bitcoin. This is because there is a lag while new bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture excess profit.

So lets take a look at how profitable it is to run an ASIC miner today.

The [Antminer S19 Pro](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A) is one of Bitmain's latest machines.  It can run an impressive 110 TH/s and uses 3250W of power. On their website Bitmain is listing them at $3769 per machine but in bulk companies can buy them for as low as $2333 (notice they are sold out until at least August).

So:

* **$2333 machine cost**
* Using $0.08/kWh electricity costs ([benchmark for electricity cost in China](https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/average-electricity-prices-kwh.html)) we get 3.25kW * $0.08 = $0.26 per hour in electricity costs. Assuming we run 24/7 this gives us $0.26 * 24 * 365 = **$2278 in electricity costs per year**
* And how many bitcoin will we mine? Well at 110 Th/s on an ASIC machine we are capturing 110/150,000,000 = 0.0000733% of the total bitcoin network per machine **at current total hash rate**. 52,560 bitcoin blocks mined per year; 6.25 bitcoin reward per block + ~1.25 bitcoin in transaction fees (avg right now) -> 7.5 bitcoin per block * 52,560 blocks -> 394.2k bitcoin per year for the entire network. 0.0000733% of this is **0.289 bitcoin per machine per year = $14,450 revenue (at $50k per bitcoin)**
* **$14,450 - $2278 = $12.2k profit per year**

You can play with the parameters to figure out different profit levels. For example, **if the total hash rate doubled to 300m Th/s, profit per machine would drop to $5k per year.**

Also note that transaction fees fluctuate over time depending on how many people are actually using bitcoin (sending and receiving transactions). See [historic transaction fees](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transaction-fees). 

And how long can you run a machine for?

Running so many calculations slows a machine quickly. Additionally, new faster hardware is introduced making past hardware unprofitable fairly quickly. **As a rule of thumb we can expect a machine to be profitable for about 2 years.** This is also the rate at which companies mark the depreciation of miners on their balance sheet.

In Year 2 the machines become much less profitable than initially.

There have been studies to see where bitcoin mining is occurring through IP address analysis of miners working in pools. The University of Cambridge has a [real-time map](https://cbeci.org/mining_map) in which we can see that in 2020 mining was:

| Country    	| % Total Hash Rate 	|
|------------	|-------------------	|
| China      	| 69%               	|
| Russia     	| 6%                	|
| US         	| 5%                	|
| Kazakhstan 	| 5%                	|
| Malaysia   	| 4%                	|
| Iran       	| 4%                	|

## **RIOT and MARA**

Now that we have a basic overview of how bitcoin mining works let's look our new investment phenomenon: publicly traded NASDAQ listed bitcoin mining companies.

## **RIOT**

Incorporated in July 2000, the company was renamed to Riot Blockchain in October 2017. The company now exclusively mines bitcoin and has a partnership with Coinmint LLC in New York who operate the miners. RIOT was a penny stock for most of its existence and was irrelevant until mid 2020.

How many miners do they have?

* Current status of pre-Dec 2020 orders: [11.5k miners in operation and 10k more to be delivered](https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/99/riot-blockchain-achieves-milestone-of-1-ehs-in-hash-rate) ([funded from $100m secondary offering in Oct 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320000871/riot_s3.htm))
* In December 2020 their stock price rocketed alongside bitcoin ($3->$15 in 1.5 months). They took advantage of this and ran a secondary offering [raising $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm). With this money [they ordered 15k more miners for $35m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001096/ex99x1.htm). Expected delivery starts in May 2021 with the bulk to be delivered in October 2021.

**Summary: 37,640 machines at full deployment. 11.5k machines today and won't be running the rest until Q3/Q4.**

So ignoring the cost of the machines:

* Operational 11.5k machines at $12.2k profit per year per machine = $137m
* Full capacity (Q3/Q4) 37.6k machine at $12.2k profit per year per machine = $459m

And assets

* Maybe $150m in cash/btc left over from secondary offering and past assets


Note: They may get cheaper electricity costs through their partnership and claim as low as $0.014 per kwh in some releases.


## **MARA**

Incorporated in 2010, the company has a wild history. It first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium, then real estate in Southern California, and most recently patent trolling. The company has some questionable leadership and has also been a penny stock for most of its existence. In 2019 (I think?) the company began delving into bitcoin mining.

In September 2019 they purchased 6k S9 Bitmain miners (13.5 TH/s) for $4m. Notice that at 13.5 TH/s: these machines are far from profitable today (I'm not even sure they were profitable back then!).

So more recently they own:

* Current status of pre-Dec 2020 orders: [6.5k miners in operation and 30k more to be delivered](https://www.marathonpg.com/news/press-releases/detail/1226/bitmain-ships-4000-antminer-s-19-pro-asic-miners-to) ([funded from $100m secondary offering in Aug 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220014870/forms-3.htm))
* In December 2020 ran another secondary offering after their stock price went from $2->$14 in a month. [They raised $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.htm). With this money they ordered 70k more miners (delivery of 7k in July, 63k in December) for $168m
* In January 2021 they ran yet another secondary offering raising [$300m more](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315221000864/forms-3asr.htm). They used $150m of this to buy 4.8k bitcoin at $31k per coin

**Summary**

* **Operational 6.5k miners = $79m per yr**
* **Full capacity (Dec 2021) 103k miners = $1.25bn per yr!**

**They also made ~$90m on their bitcoin holdings so far ($150m -> ~$240m)**

Impressive numbers right? Well..

## **Too good to be true?**

So what are RIOT and MARA trading at you may ask?

With the recent jump of bitcoin to $50k, RIOT and MARA have rocketed.

* RIOT closed at $77.90 per share, **a market cap of $5.3bn**
* MARA closed at $47.90 per share, **a market cap of $4.5bn**

Investor euphoria is at all time highs. So much so that their price action has rapidly [outpaced](https://i.imgur.com/VjQTaA3.png) and [diverged](https://i.imgur.com/wwzoTn6.png) from bitcoin.

So is it because they have such huge potential? If RIOT gets all of its hardware delivered is it really going to be making $459m per year? And MARA $1.25bn per year!?!

Well, probably not..

* As bitcoin price goes up, mining becomes VERY profitable and there is a rush to build and deploy more hardware. From Oct to Dec 2017 the price of bitcoin famously went from $4k to $20k. Total hash rate went up about 60% during this time. [However, it went up a massive 600% over the following 9 months as new miners were produced and deployed](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) with a lag.
* As the price of bitcoin capped out and then dipped mining soon became unprofitable at such a high total hash rate and miners lost a lot of money.
* Both RIOT and MARA are pending receipt of the majority of their miners and won't be taking delivery until late 2021/early 2022. What will the network's total hash rate be by then? What will bitcoin price be by then? Chinese miners won't be sitting by idle.
* And we ignored the cost of the machines! In the future RIOT and MARA will need to buy new machines. Regardless of the market the old ASIC miners will quickly trend towards unprofitability. Bitcoin is closed system; There will only be a maximum of 328.5k + tx fees of bitcoin mined per year. In fact, this will reduce in 2024 with the next ""halving"". A company cannot reliably mine more bitcoin/capture more of the network because if they are finding it profitable to increase their hash rate then you can be certain every other miner is doing the same. How many $100m secondary offerings can they do for this free lunch?
* Take a look at the [past financials of these companies](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320000948/riot10qq3-0920.htm). RIOT mined an ""impressive"" $2.4m worth of bitcoin in Q3 2020. Their costs were $1.3m in electricity/rent/etc. + $1.2m depreciation ($2.5m!). Once you add in their $2m of salaries and marketing they had an operating loss of -$2.1m for the quarter. Their bitcoin did appreciate by a cool $385k meaning their net loss for the quarter ended at -$1.7m.
* Of course their next quarter should look wildly better thanks to bitcoins Q4 2020 price action. But this is not a business that is massively profitable under normal market conditions.


The bull case:

* Bitcoin keeps rocketing and never comes back. The total hash rate doesn't catch up and $50k btc becomes $1m btc. MARA's $1.25bn revenue next year becomes $12.5bn before ASIC miner production catches up. Investors doubled their money.


Of course, if it becomes so profitable one wonders if Bitmain decides it is better value to use the miner's themselves and breach their contract.

## **Tobin's Q**

Simply stated, when you invest in a RIOT or MARA you are investing in the profitability/unprofitability of bitcoin mining over the next 1-2 years.

It could be hugely profitable, or it could crash and burn like it did in 2018 and you see no returns.

In this instance, you are paying the executive team of MARA and RIOT to buy the hardware, plug it in, and sell any bitcoin for you. There isn't much more to it than that - you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity.

So perhaps a good way to see what kind of premium you are paying to own bitcoin miner exposure through these NASDAQ companies is the [Q Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin%27s_q). The Q ratio is the market cap of the company divided by the replacement costs of its assets.

RIOT

* Market Cap $5.3bn
* Current btc miners 11.5k ($27m)
* Ordered btc miners 26k ($60m)
* $150m cash remaining (guess)
* **A whopping Q ratio of 22.4! And 63% of that is cash, 25% in orders!**

MARA

* Market Cap $4.5bn
* Current btc miners 6.5k ($15m)
* Ordered btc miners 96.5k ($225m)
* $240m in bitcoin
* $100m cash remaining (guess)
* **A ""value"" Q ratio of 7.75!**

With this approach, RIOT is trading at a 22.4x premium today and MARA a 7.75x.

A criticism of this valuation methodology may be that it is justified paying a premium when orders for new hardware are so backlogged. Just remember that these companies are also stuck in that backlog and won't have most of their machines online until 2022. Is it really worth such a premium?

---

## **Other factors to consider**

These companies have questionable management. **The CEO of MARA has awarded himself [compensation in excess of $300m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315221000469/form8-k.htm) over the last few months. Realise that the market cap of MARA was less than $300m just 3 months ago.**

Both companies are quick to do secondary offering after secondary offering at such high prices. MARA has been more aggressive recently and the downward pressure of insider selling and secondary share offerings has resulted in the price moving from $20->$48 in the time RIOT has gone from $20->$77.

A read through both of their 10-Qs will give you paragraphs of legal claims, shareholder class actions, and past investment write-offs due to corruption/shady circumstances.

These companies have no moat. They have no IP. They have no key talent hires. They are simply ordering ASIC miners, plugging them in, and having the biggest pay-days of their lives.

## **Trading strategies**

So is there a trading strategy I would recommend?

### **Bear**

**The challenge with being a bear in this market is you have to seriously consider whether the risk/reward is there for betting on the downside.**

Right now the market doesn't care for your fundamentals. Bitcoin has passed $50k, the narrative is that its going to $100k. The market expects these stocks to continue to trade at multiples and be 10x higher in a month.

It sounds ridiculous but it keeps happening. It is far too dangerous to be short these stocks. Or worse, short calls and you could be bankrupt on 1 intra-day move.

So that leaves you with puts. Average implied vol nearing 300% does not make them cheap.

If you truly have conviction that there will be a correction in the near term then consider weekly bear spreads.

Longer DTE plays are insanely expensive and run the risk of the many secondary offerings eventually justifying a price higher than your price target.

Another interesting idea would be a relative trade. If you could find exposure to bitcoin mining at <20x premium your long run earnings could net out. However, all publicly traded companies are similarly ludicrous so you'd have to buy a stake in btc mining privately or try and own some ASIC miners yourself.

More simply you could go long bitcoin and short RIOT/MARA. This should converge in the long run. The risk is that short term the short position will be impossible to risk manage and there is always the risk of more secondary offerings.


### **Bull**

Buy as far OTM weekly calls as you can at 400% IV and hope that momentum market continues. Fundamentals are for the 2010s.

---

### **Other**

Both RIOT and MARA's stock price spent some time consolidating down from ~28 to the 16-22 range when bitcoin corrected back from its initial $45k run up back to to $30k.

It is possible they will again if bitcoin has a pullback. However, the price action of these stocks has diverged even from bitcoin for the time being.

Ultimately the price action we are seeing now is purely momentum/hype/technical and probably retail driven. Long term and as far as future earnings go this play is a loser. But be careful; that doesn't seem to matter right now.

138,1730915154.0,What are your expectations for green/renewable energy stocks under a Trump presidency?,"I bought some FAN (wind) and TAN (solar) back in 2021, hopeful that energy stocks would do well because of growing environmental concerns and attempts to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately, they’ve not been doing well at all. FAN has dropped over 20% since I bought it, and TAN has dropped over 50%. They’re pretty much the only stocks I own that have given me a long term loss 

Woke up today to a Trump victory and both stocks dropping by over 5% despite the rest of the market rallying. I know in part that might be due to people selling yesterday in anticipation of a possible Trump victory (I know I was thinking of selling yesterday, but the market closed before I made a decision), but I’m curious what people think about the more long term performance of green energy stocks?

I’ve been thinking of selling for a while, but so far I’ve convinced myself that the stocks are probably going down now because of high initial production prices, but that they’ll probably go up again in the future. However, I’m skeptical of them doing well under a Trump presidency, at least compared to a Harris presidency, considering how little priority Trump gives to environmental causes and renewable energy. Also the fact that a lot of solar panels come from China with high tariffs

Any thoughts on this?",Reddit

This is my first time posting here, so I appreciate any helpful comments! 

I've been investing since 2019, and recently have gotten back into it after a long hiatus. I've invested in some standard ETFs like VOO, IGM, etc. and am now looking to diversify my portfolio and develop a long term strategy.

As a personal advocate of the merits of nuclear energy, I wanted to garner some opinions on the outlook of nuclear power and/or the uranium mining industry. I've read some past posts on this sub and the general sentiment seems to be lukewarm; that it may play out long term but it's a relatively mixed bag at this point. So far, my watchlist is comprised of:

* NUKZ
* NLR
* NXE
* CCJ
* UEC
* UROY

Since I've read a good amount of opinions from past posts on this sub, I wanted to ask more specifically for where I can access good resources to read updates, projections, and general trends in the nuclear energy sector? Any help is appreciated, thanks so much! ",Reddit

So if Energy was 5% of the S&P prior to the downturn and gets cut in half, thats 2.5% off of the overall index.  But now if it gets cut in half again it's only 1.25% off the overall index.

Same with all the physical retail thats getting pummeled right now.  Look at the market caps of all these companies, if you combine the market caps of all physical retailers together it doesn't even add up to an Amazon, Microsoft, or Google.

145,1611493796.0,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

146,1747232296.0,Why aren’t Treasury investors sounding the alarm about the Tax Cut extension?,"Congress has released draft legislative text for extending the 2017 tax cuts. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the proposed legislation would add $5.6 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, to be offset by $1.9 trillion in spending reductions, for a net cost of $3.7 trillion. (Source: https://thehill.com/business/budget/5297588-republicans-tax-bill-jct/amp/ )

This is on top of a national debt figure that's already projected to rise above $50 trillion by the end of this decade without new fiscally expansionary legislation being passed.

Some Republicans representing battleground states have criticized the proposed spending reductions (mainly to lower-income social welfare programs & clean energy incentives) as being politically unpalatable. Historically, when this happens, congressional leadership tends to trim down some of the cuts & throw the cost onto the deficit, because these battleground legislators are on the front lines of deciding which party wins the majority.

Even the draft $3.7T cost would be by far the most expensive legislation ever passed, exceeding the 2020 CARES Act, the 2021 Rescue Plan, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction (EV incentives) Act. And it’s unlikely to be a large stimulus to economic growth, considering that most of the bill simply extends the 2017 tax reform (although there are some targeted new provisions like no tax on tips etc.)

Three years ago, when Liz Truss proposed big (and largely-unfunded) tax cuts in the UK, bond investors sent Gilt yields soaring from 3.5% to 5%, requiring the Bank of England to intervene. Truss resigned as Prime Minister after only 45 days, and she lost her Parliament seat in the next election.

Meanwhile, Treasury investors have remained calm. 10-year yields have settled around 4.5% in the last few days, and in fact are slightly lower today. They don’t seem to be alarmed by the exponential growth in deficits & the national debt. What explains this?

This topic isn't a political debate about the pros & cons of tax cuts & spending cuts. It's about the economic implications and impact on asset prices.",Reddit
147,1735934973.0,My perspective on Hydrograph Clean energy ,"
This is not investment advice just my perspective on Hydrograph Clean Energy: Ticker symbol HG.CN. I highly recommend you do your own reasearch into this company.

TLDR:  the company is well-positioned to lead the future of nano-materials and provide long-term returns if they can continue to scale by producing machines and expanding to additional locations.The primary challenge lies in perfecting graphene’s application.

Investing in hydrograph clean energy, particularly through the innovative Hyperion system and its patented technology, offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for sustainable and efficient energy solutions. Hyperion’s design outperforms competitors by providing scalable, low-maintenance, and cost-effective energy systems capable of producing high-quality graphene (99.8%)—a critical material for the future of technology. Each Hyperion unit can generate up to 10 tonnes of graphene annually, with each tonne valued at $200,000, translating to $2 million in revenue per machine per year. Their strategy is straightforward: secure additional funding to scale production and forge more strategic partnerships. However, the primary challenge lies in the material science behind properly applying “the wonder material” of our generation—graphene. At 200 times stronger than steel, more conductive than copper, and incredibly lightweight, graphene holds transformative potential across industries, particularly in batteries, microchips, and the tech sector. Currently, Hydrograph Clean Energy already accounts for over 10% of the global graphene industry. With demand for graphene and other nanomaterials expected to triple over the next five years, investing in this technology now represents a potentially lucrative opportunity. Moreover, the integration of graphene and nanomaterials into clean energy systems promises groundbreaking advances in energy storage, efficiency, and durability. This combination positions the company to lead the next generation of clean energy infrastructure, while providing long-term value for early investors who recognize the potential of this emerging technology.",Reddit

150,1611722428.0,"Energy Sector Stock, Undervalued : OXY"," What do you think of OXY?

I think it is the best stock in Energy Sector currently.

&#x200B;

STOCK TICKER: OXY

Current Price: $20.38

Short Volume: Around 60%

OXY has been an easy target for short sellers for more than a year.

OXY was so undervalued due to Energy sector, and 3.8 B loss in 3rd quarter.

1. OXY is one of top 3 shale oil company in US. It was expected to be TOP 1 or TOP 2 in 2020 if there was no COVID-19. With a high priced merger in 2019, OXY tanked all in 2020.

**P/E raito is still -1.28** which is crazy as other Energy companies (CVX -13.95, BP -3.58, TOT -19.14, PSX -11,76, RDS A -8.9)

OXY's position : **break even is $35** for crude oil price (current crude Oil price $52.77) WHY is OXY Shorted STILL???

**OXY makes $17.77/ each Barrel (34%)**

According to Merill, at **$47 WTI, unlevered free cash will be $4.1 BN** which will exceed 3rd quarter loss.

We are expecting huge surprise on earning.

2. To use Biden’s green Energy, Crude oil price has to be above $75 (42%higher than the current price) which is currently (**$52.77**). Green Energy companies were peaked when Crude oil price was over $100 in 2007\~2008. And, due to Russia event, the crude oil price will jump soon or later. Russia was the one who opposed Oil production cut down but they are busy with politics in the homeland. (Hope for the best)

3. Many Energy companies including OXY, they are changing carbon free production which will benefit them financially and investing on Green Energy sector.

4.  **short volume (60%)**, Why does individual investors have to suffer from firms' short positions?

5. The Legend, **Carl Icahn**, is still on OXY. He is heavily invested in OXY position. (It will be his return from failure of HERTZ (which short sellers put it down))",Reddit

155,1610598776.0,[DD] 12k on NextEra Energy (NEE) LEAPs as a clean energy play,"I  wasn't really planning on making a post on this, but I'd like to make the case for investing in a utilities company focused on clean energy as a smart play for the upcoming stimulus/shift towards renewables.

So what's NextEra Energy? Summarized from Wikipedia:

* It is the largest electric utility in the USA by market capitalization. (At 160B currently)
* Revenues of over $19.20 billion in 2019. Operating income of $5.35 billion in 2019.
* About 14,000 employees throughout the US and Canada.
* The important subsidiaries include
   * The Utilities;
      * Florida Power & Light (FPL) - A Florida electric utility. Notable for having wider profit margins than usual.
      * Gulf Power Company - Electric utility in the Alabama area
   * NextEra Energy Capital Holdings (NEECH)
      * NextEra  Energy Resources (NEER) - The largest operators of wind and solar  projects in the world. Importantly, expansive holdings in the Midwest.  Also has numerous energy storage projects under their belt.
* They also have a 35% stake in NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) with Jim Robo being the CEO of both companies.

[In  fact, I'll just direct you to NextEra's IR page, because for some  reason they've placed a very solid series of pages outlining their  financial health where almost nobody will find them.](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/fixed-income-investors/financial-policy) You can flip  through the Policy, Strength, Funding/Capital Structure, Cash  Flow/Leverage, and Liquidity pages there at your leisure to understand  more about the company. But basically, they're extremely healthy as a  company. Notably, they've been [unwinding positions for cash](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/11-02-2020-222338600) recently despite their solid balance sheet.

Now,  I'd like to point out their P/E: 41. Yup, this is a ""boring"" utility company trading at 41x P/E after running up 200% in 5 years and 80% in  2. For reference, Microsoft is trading at 34.90 P/E. As far as utilities  go, I think it's fair to say these guys are as far from boring as it  gets.

Summary of the fundamentals;

1. Management is extremely reliable
2. They're the market leader in renewables deployment
3. They've proven they know how to compete and edge out profits in cutthroat industries
4. High P/E, but in a stable industry
5. They have plenty of leverage available for massive capital expenditures

Now  onto why I think they will collect more than their fair share of  Biden's upcoming stimulus. Let's start off by looking at what Biden has  been pushing in his announcements;

1. Pushing the environmental costs onto polluters
2. Pushing renewables directly
3. Creating long-term middle class union jobs

Among utilities, [NextEra stands out as an early and consistent investor in renewables](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-11-2020-173514490). Straight from the link above:

>According  to S&P Global Trucost, NextEra Energy ranked ahead of its peers on a  number of impressive reported performance metrics, among others,  including signed contracts to build approximately 12,000 megawatts of  additional wind, solar and battery storage projects as of the close of  2019, and NextEra Energy's announced target of emissions reductions per  unit of generation by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, equivalent, to a  40% reduction in absolute emissions – and this, despite an expected  doubling of generation over the period. Already, NextEra Energy reports  more than 50% of its generation is from zero- and near-zero-emitting  sources.

I think it's fair to say that point 1 will hurt them much less than it will their less progressive competition.

Additionally,  as a result of their investments so far, they're not untested when it  comes to deployment: They know what to expect and we know they can  execute on larger CapEx programs with less risk than the competition. If  Biden is to throw the expected 40 billion a year into the industry,  it's quite likely NextEra will be ready to scale up operations  sustainably and successfully to capitalize on the opportunity, clearing  point two.

But point three is the  really interesting one. Let me start off with a question; If you were a  democratic president that wanted to create middle-class jobs in  renewables, how would you go about it? Would you invest in the companies  making the end product? Maybe a little for the companies that pull the  required resources out of the ground too?

[Let's  take a look at what the clean energy portion stimulus bill a few weeks  ago contained and see how NextEra is positioned for each portion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/khx7eb/stimulus_bill_includes_35_billion_for_clean/) Big thanks to [/u/millerlit](https://www.reddit.com/u/millerlit/) for summarizing. Also, [I'll be referencing the NextEra 2019 annual report from this point on](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/reports-and-filings/annual-reports). Please bring up a copy if you'd like to verify the numbers I claim.

* $1.5 Billion for Solar - Will probably go to most industry players pretty  equally, NextEra will get a cut as a result of their investing through NEER. 12% of NEER's generation is from solar power according to the 2019 annual report (p.13).
* $2.6 Billion for Transport - NextEra probably won't get much of this, but they have [made an acquisition](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-08-2020-123104618) in the field within the last month. It would be a nice perk if they  announced major projects here, but let's just leave this as a  hypothetical.
* $1.7 billion for a Weatherization Assistance Program - I'm not 100% sure how  they'll break this down, but up here in Canada they do these programs  as rebates through utility providers. [NextEra is almost definitely going to get a cut of this as far as I can see.](https://www.fpl.com/save/programs.html)
* $1.08 billion for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy  storage technologies - NextEra is pretty big in the battery storage  field. [I don't think they'll be the ones developing a new battery chemistry, but they're definitely a serious user.](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nextera-energy-to-spend-1b-on-energy-storage-projects-in-2021)
* $2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies. -  They're going to get a serious cut of this for obvious reasons.
* $625  million for new research, development and commercialization for both  onshore and offshore wind technologies - 65% of NEER's renewables  generation is wind power according to the 2019 annual report. They're  going to get a nice cut here too.
* $850 million for geothermal technology development - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I'm aware.
* $1093 million for marine energy and hydropower tech - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I'm aware.
* $500 million pot for industry and transportation looking to decarbonize - 0 stake in this race
* $6.2  billion for carbon capture utilization and storage technologies - FPL  is investing quite heavily here, as 74% of their generation back in 2019  was from Natural Gas (p.9). They're going to get a good portion of  this.
* $6.6  billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power  plants and the development of advanced reactors - FPL generated 22% of  their power from Nuclear in 2019 (p.9). They're probably going to get a  fair slice of this.
* $4.7 billion for fusion industry - NextEra isn't spending money on fusion development, as far as I'm aware.
* Looser  regulations for using government land for renewables - A nice gesture  to drop land costs by increasing supply for sustainable uses. [Here's a map of US public land so you can take a look.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/US_federal_land.agencies.svg/1280px-US_federal_land.agencies.svg.png)

But you get the point by now - NextEra has a slice in a lot of these pies directly. On top of that, the renewables segment as a whole is going to hugely benefit from the stimulus driving down the capital expenditures required for panels and turbines. Frankly, there are very few people  better positioned than a well-run utility company with massive credit  available taking on the debt at great rates. When I put it like that, it's no surprise that these folks managed to thrive under Trump's policies - and that they're extremely well positioned to grow aggressively under Biden.

But there's even a fun political trap for the republicans here. Do you know  where the best place to place on-shore wind turbines is? [The midwest](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/itl/sed/gsg/mri50_2mph_inc_gumbel_v2.png) ([Source](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/maps-non-hurricane-non-tornadic-extreme-wind-speeds-contiguous-united-states)) - [A notable republican stronghold area](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=US+2020+election+results). NEER's own wind turbine deployment map in the annual report (p.13) backs up that their expansion is largely in that area.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Democrats quietly slated a lot of  the renewables spending into the midwest in an attempt to entrench a pro-union and pro-clean energy vote there - forcing the republican platform into a weird spot in future elections. It helps that that's pretty much the economical way to play it too.

To sum it up, I think NextEra's going to be a serious beneficiary of the renewables bill however it ends up going down, even if only because of their financial resources, deployment experience, and contracts with  suppliers. A big portion of this is that I don't believe the market has  priced in the amount they're collecting directly and indirectly because  the response so far seems to have been ""FAN/TAN/ICLN/QCLN goes brrrrr"".

Let's talk about the competition; The other US utility companies that were  listed as leaders in the clean energy transition by Global Platts are  Dominion Energy, Sempra Energy, and Xcel Energy. From one look at them  it seems like they're (1) much smaller and (2) at best half off on P/E  so I didn't really look at them too hard if I'm being honest.

Now for the bigger question; Do I grab NEE or \[clean energy ETF of choice\]?  Really, it's up to you. I think that the clean energy ETFs are trading  at downright idiotic valuations now. That, and I'd much rather bet on  one or two known strong performers that I believe in than I would on a  bunch of companies picked by someone else. That being said, those ETFs  have much more hype behind them, which is an important consideration in  this market.

Short-term catalysts  are basically the stimulus bill and earnings on the 26th. I expect some  big announcements on how they plan to capitalize on the bill during the  earnings call, and a huge bump in interest if they announce that they're  accelerating their renewables pipeline and focusing on that portion of  the company more.

Anyways, onto positions and how I'd trade it;

* If  you just want to buy and hold in an account for the extreme long-term  -> buy shares and hold, I think this is going to heavily outperform  the S&P 500 into the future.
* If  you want to get some of the spicy synthetic leverage gains with me  -> Jan 20 2023 80c's. They print if the stock goes up \~15% in the  next 2 years because IV is super low. I grabbed 10 at 12.10 at the start  of the week on the dip, but I think they'll open 13.00+ tomorrow. Keep  in mind that you don't need to hold till expiry, I'll probably liquidate  these after a year because I want the tax benefits.

157,1609988027.0,TSLA - Tesla market value today is more valuable than all the world's major auto makers combined - what gives?,"Tesla market value today (716 Billion) is about the same as  the market value of all the world's major car makers combined.  In addition China's BYDDY (86B) and Nio (78B) are both more valuable than Daimler (74B) even though NIO only delivered less than 40,000 cars in all of 2020 with huge loss. China's LI and XPEV combined market value are similar to GM (61B), which has production in China and has a worldwide lineup of EV to be on the market in the next few years.

With the exception of autonomous driving, EV manufacturing appears to have a low technology barrier to entry, that's why we have so many EV car companies pops up all over the world. Everybody used the same Total Addressable Market to justify their future value. I don't think autonomous driving is a must have in buying an EV, so the competition will be intense once all ICV companies start to produce their lineup of EVs in the near future.

Since Auto industry is a cyclical business, historically, the market value of the auto companies were somewhat depressed as compared to other high growth industries. Since there is a limit on how many cars will be sold in a year based on historical trends, I don't know how we can justify doubling or tripling the total market value of the whole auto industry unless all the non-Tesla companies lost significant amount of their market value, which is not likely (you are talking about fierce competitors like Toyota, Daimler, Honda, GM, etc)

The first movers (Tesla, BYDDY, Nio, Xpev) are catching all the investment dollars, driving their stock to current nose bleeding price.  Once all major car makers start to deliver EVs, supply and demand will determine their profit margin, future cash flow and true present value.

Who the hell cares?  This fear mongering of what might happen tomorrow is some shit i'm tryna leave behind in 2020.  The bigger picture here is that our very landscape has changed in the last 2 decades and we have to stop being scared of change and fear of a correction.  Can it happen?  Sure, in fact it probably should happen but will that change anything in the long term?  No.  Here's a few differences between our very economy now versus what it was like 10-20 years ago...

We live in a day and age where more people have access to investing in our history with zero commission trading fees and apps like robinhood, acorns, or betterment that appeal appeal to the beginner investor.  The result is that the younger and younger generations are becoming more involved in the investment sector of the economy.  Coupled with the fact that a large part of these young investors Millenials and Gen Z, do not own a home and/or live with their parents they have more freedom to put their disposable income into the market.  What's interesting is that millennials are actually one of the most cynical generations towards the stock market mostly because we have lived through two major recessions in recent times and have a large distrust placed in large financial institutions.  This seems to have fundamentally changed proportion of americans who are benefitting from the stock markets bull run from an individual standpoint.  However, with the rise of 401(k) benefits offered by employers and expansion of these plans, millennials are shifting more disposable income towards these options as opposed to self directed or individual plans which tells a different story.

We live in a day and age where new financial instruments and investing options are dominating the market popularity.  The historic rise of ETFs approx +6,000 since 2009 have ushered in a new era of low cost diversification for the average investor.  Employers are increasing 401(k) benefits and company match policies allowing for large capital accumulation among younger investors who are reaping the benefits.  The rise of cryptocurrency has brought in an entirely new method to invest in the future which is particularly attractive to the younger generations who have lived through the technology era and have seen what investments in the future can look like.

We live in a day and age where we are exchanging information at the blink of an eye with a simple google search.  Trend identification and data analysis in this day and age is easily accessible and a powerful tool to the average investor.  Things such as cloud computing, AI, Genomics, blockchain, green/renewable energy are changing the foundation of our future and these ideas aren't going away anytime soon.  Access to social media, blogs, investment forums have never been easier and will continue to advance our general education and understanding.

Who knows what the next 10, 20, or even 50 years will bring?  I don't know but i'm certain that **change is here to stay** so stop worrying and embrace the unknown.

While I do agree with you in the fact that some of these company valuations are insane and this bull market cannot be seen as sustainable in the short run I think it's important to weigh those concerns with the macroeconomic factors that have changed the investment landscape in the last 10-20 years.  You should have a healthy dose of skepticism otherwise you will be caught off guard but you should also take into account the investing world is evolving and traditional metrics and guidelines in which investors have traditionally based their investment decisions on needs to adapt with it.  What remains true is that not all great things can last forever and a healthy correction is brewing in the future and trying to time it is, and always will be, the worst mistake you can make.  DCA into your positions has and always will be no matter what the best way to invest.

Who knows what the investment landscape will look like in 10-50 years?  Creative destruction in our world knows no bounds and we are constantly advancing toward it.  Change is brought on by optimism and in a 2020 lacking that - heres to a forward looking future built on the backs of bulls!

Edit 1:  Been getting a lot of traction and appreciation as well as hate for this post so I want to clarify a few things about what i'm tryna say here.

1.  I am not saying invest heavy into Technology/Clean energy or any of the other crazy shit that's been popping cause it will stay that way.  I am saying that look at what technology and advancements we have made just in the last 10-20 years as a global population and tried to tie it to financial advancements related to technology.  What will the next 50 years bring?  I don't know but i'm excited to find out.
2. I am aware that we are in uncharted waters here as a country and there are a lot of risks regarding the economy right now.  You'd be an idiot to think that there are not going to be consequences for the amount of money printing we've been doing.  The M1 money supply just shot up this last year and if we hit inflation we could be in trouble.  Invest smart, look for value, average in, don't buy into the hype/FOMO, you'll be setting yourself up for some losses.
3. My post is geared to a lot of the newer investors that are coming into this space trying to figure out what the fuck to do with their money.  A lot of them are scared about what could happen with the economic factors right now.  I am saying that look at us as a whole in a broader sense of the market - look what we have done in the past 10-20 years as a nation and as a global population.  It's fucking exciting and that innovation and drive for the next generation future will never stop.  Think long term always as a new investors, you're young and can handle losses.  I saw a comment on another thread saying ""take your initial losses as tuition in learning how to invest"" and that is the mindset of a winner in the long run.  Investment in yourself and making your dollar work for you is building that future and its exciting.
4. Stop calling me stupid/naive it hurts my feelings lol.  I'm a youngin who wants all this 2020 fear and negativity to stop and I want my fellow youngins to join me in building a better future.

Cheers!

163,1748478186.0,The Euphoric Blip Before the Storm,"The domestic political and geopolitical ramifications of this are going to be very interesting.

The administration is forced to either blatantly ignore the courts in the most globally, publicly recognizable way possible or capitulate and lose what leverage and respect they thought they had with every country on the planet.

They pissed off every country in the world and spat all over them at every possible occasion. And the House burned all of its political capital to squeeze by a disaster of a bill. The only way they could tell everyone it was going to be paid for was by tariffs and cuts. Tariffs just got taken out. 

The funny part is it doesn’t really matter what they do — ie attempt to ignore it or get a stay and tie it up in the courts or comply (no way, that’s not their style, but it’s not impossible — in any case, it’s moot). The signal has been sent, the king has been shown to bleed. 

Stocks may rip, but I think it will be short-lived; I’d be more willing to say bonds crash as lenders realize this will get tied up in the courts and scare off any chance of the Senate passing it in the aftermath of this disaster. It’s DOA. That’s not even considering the astronomical domestic business pressure they’re already certainly feeling as businesses across the country now have a legal decision to exempt them from anything the administration tries to do now. It’s weak but enough of a safe bet to plan around for a business leader, owner, operator to make decisions.

As for the geopolitical situation, I’d imagine there are a good number of reasons for the world to feel the bully who threatened so much to so many shouldn’t be made to atone for its hubris. Supply chains have been dramatically disrupted and reoriented and our debt and dollar depend on the world we disrespected and threatened feeling that we are trustworthy debtors and agreeable partners. The domestic factors already mentioned strongly suggest both of these tenets have been violated in scarring and long lasting ways. Enough of the world has started to meaningfully question American exceptionalism and to put (or rather begin moving) their money where their mouth is — demanding higher yields on Treasuries, the Taiwanese dollar spike, foreign currency and equity market record appreciation… you get the idea. This gives them the signal they need to begin offloading our debt based on the same risk assessment that domestic businesses are playing. There’s no way for them to fund this now and everyone now knows it can’t be furnished by force from anywhere except inside the country itself. Our debt “crisis” is now an actual crisis.

Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary (and former Fed head) is saying that if lawmakers fail to raise or abolish the national debt limit, the US will likely run out of cash around June 1 - a month from now.

5. Financial Analysis
6. Valuation / Key Risks

**1. Business Model**

*What does Loop do?*

Loop designs, manufactures, sells, and services hydrogen fuel cell systems for the electrification of commercial vehicles. Its near-term focus markets include light/medium trucks (e.g. home delivery vehicles), semi-trucks, buses, and other commercial vehicles (mining, etc), with long-term plans to expand into other intermodal transport (marine, rail, etc).

*What is its product offering?*

Loop’s key products are fuel cell stacks (stacks of fuel cells that produce electricity and water when supplied with hydrogen and oxygen) and fuel cell modules (fuel cell stacks along with the balance of plant - all the necessary equipment to operate) and has manufacturing facilities in British Columbia, Canada, and Langfang, China. Loop believes that through its proprietary eFlow technology, its fuel cell systems are superior to its peers in terms of fuel efficiency, durability, and power.  We expect these characteristics to be key differentiators as Loop and its competitors race to secure OEM relationships and achieve mass-market adoption.

*Understanding the current landscape and Loop’s competitive advantages*

On the path to transitioning the global fleet to zero-emissions vehicles, Loop sees the current lithium-ion batteries as only a part of the solution, with its hydrogen fuel cells creating significant advantages over the existing solutions in terms of range, payload, and refueling times. Loop markets three key benefits to its fuel cells, compared to competitors, which we think well-position the company to continue to lead its industry. In addition to the technical competitive advantages which are outlined in the *Competitive Landscape* section, we see Loop’s industry positioning is supported by Cummin’s investment and its partnership with OEMs.

*Growth Strategy*

The company has rapidly developed its business development pipeline, forming partnerships with OEMs and building a relatively small revenue backlog of $16.4 million to date, with plans of significantly expanding this over time. The company expects that the larger OEM suppliers will be in a position to launch commercial vehicles with fuel cell systems between 2025 and 2027, meaning the company’s near-term focus should be on manufacturing fuel cell vessels in smaller volumes and developing its technology and backlog. Loop also has a JV with InPower in China to establish a manufacturing line. We think Loop’s stated strategy (below) is well-aligned with the most important objective - becoming the dominant player in the industry.

*Loop Growth Strategy*

1. Focus on commercial vehicle market and leverage products into other markets
2. Scale manufacturing and customer support infrastructure
3. Develop partnerships with leading OEMs and OEM suppliers
4. Reduce costs by leveraging scale and internalizing certain components
5. Continue to invest to develop and improve eFlow technology

**2. Management, Board, and Ownership Overview**

Loop’s management team is highly experienced with significant experience in related industries, including fuel cell development and automotive development (key relationships at strategically important OEMs). The company also appointed two special advisors with excellent track records leading companies: Lord John Browne (BP, Riverstone) and Lance Uggla (IHS Market, S&P Global). With its recent additions, we view Loop’s management team and board as a strength.

The current and pro forma ownership of the company is included below. Upon completion of the offering, there will be a concurrent reverse stock split, consolidating 3 shares into 1 share, which is noted below, along with the forced conversion of convertible debentures, reflected in the table below:

&#x200B;

|**Beneficial Owner**|**Fully Diluted Current Ownership (post-consolidation)**|**Pro Forma Fully Diluted Ownership** (assumes $115mn allotment at $16/share)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cummins|6.9mn (25.4%)|6.9mn (17.5%)|
|InPower|1.3mn (4.9%)|1.3mn (3.4%)|
|Management & Board|2.9mn (10.6%)|2.9mn (7.3%)|
|Other|16.2mn (59.1%)|23.3mn (59.0%)|
|Options & Warrants Exercised|0 (0%)|2.7mn (6.7%)|
|Convertible Debentures Converted|0 (0%)|2.4mn (6.1%)|
|**Total**|**27.3mn (100%)**|**39.6mn (100%)**|

&#x200B;

**3. Market Overview / Competitive Landscape**

*Industry Overview*

The market for fuel cell electric vehicles is expected to grow at a 39% CAGR, from \~$2.6bn today to $50.8bn. Hydrogen fuel cells are the most widely adopted form, with significant investments from governments and corporates to support the widespread adoption of hydrogen. The hydrogen market is expected to represent \~€10 trillion+, with countries representing \~70% of the world’s GDP introducing hydrogen strategies (including US and Russia).  While this is clearly a growing, attractive and strategic market, we do note that many industry data sources provided by management are sponsored research, including the Hydrogen Council.

We see electrification as an important global trend as countries and companies commit to decreasing emissions, with a target of net-zero by 2050.

Loop’s competitors include Ballard Power, Beijing Sinohytec, Horizon Fuel Technologies, Hydrogenics Corporation, Hyundai, Nuvera Fuel Cells, Plug Power. Powercell, and Toyota. Despite this strong group of competitors, Loop’s technology provides significant competitive advantages, noting that competitors pose a significant risk for the company (see *Key Risks to Loop’s Valuation)*

*Competitive Advantages (per Loop)*

* Fuel Efficiency - efficiency improvements enable greater savings and higher return on investment
   * According to Loop, the incorporation of fuel cells into battery electric vehicles increases range by 2.5 to 3 times
   * 16% lower fuel consumption vs. competitors, generating \~$300k in fuel savings over lifetime
* Higher Peaking Power - provides higher payload capacity and range
   * \>50% more peak power than top competitor and >90% more peak power than most competitors
* Durability - results in lower service and maintenance costs
   * Up to 10x better current density uniformity

**4. IPO Details**

*Overview of the Offering*

Loop issued its preliminary prospectus on February 5, 2021, announcing plans to raise \~$100mn (+15% greenshoe option) at an \~$12-$16/share valuation. Shares are expected to price the week of February 15, 2021 and trade the week of February 22, 2021. The IPO will be led by National Bank Financial. Per filings, the net proceeds are expected to be used for R&D, capital assets, and other expenses.

Funds from the strategic financing will be used to further accelerate the company's product development activities, project deployments, and growth plans as it expands its technical leadership in medium and heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell bus and trucking applications.

*Share Count*

Loop’s current fully-diluted share count pre-IPO is \~30.0 million shares, and pro forma for the offering will increase to \~39.6 million shares (assuming shares price at the top range of indications and the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option).

*Previous Equity Raises*

Based on Cummin’s prior investments in the company and current shares owned, Cummin’s cost basis is \~$4.32/share.

**5. Financial Analysis**

*Revenue* was \~$350k for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily representing the sale of demo field and test bench units. This will increase as the business continues to develop its product backlog, noting Loop’s definition of this figure represents estimated sales, including conditional agreements and MOUs. We view the development of this product backlog and execution to be a key risk, as this backlog may or may not actually materialize.

*Product Backlog* as of January 31, 2021 represents revenue of $16.4mn, up from $4.3mn as of December 31, 2020.

*Operating Expenses* \- the company expects to achieve gross margins of \~30% and EBIT margins of 20% by 2030, supported by its eFlow technology, which the company expects to reduce manufacturing costs. We think that Loop’s approach to design in-house and expand vertically along the supply chain will be beneficial to achieve best-in-class margins. Given the significant size of the addressable market, economies of scale, and importance of reaching the “tipping point” for mass-market adoption, we expect significant M&A in the near-term. We also expect strategic M&A to be viewed favourably by the market with the understanding that despite near-term dilution, these types of transactions should be accretive to long-term value.

*Capital Structure -* pro forma for the offering, Loop’s balance sheet will substantially change, with the majority of its debt (convertible debentures) converting into shares, leaving Loop with an essentially debt-free balance sheet.

&#x200B;

|**($ millions)**|**30-Sep-20**|**Adjustment**|**Pro Forma**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|(+) LT Debt|0.8||0.8||
|(+) Convertible Debentures|3.6|(3.6)|–|Converted|
|**Total Debt**|**4.4**|**(3.6)**|**0.8**||
|(-) Cash|6.3|115|121.3|IPO proceeds + conversion of warrants and options|
|**Net Debt**|**(1.9)**|**(118.6)**|**(120.5)**||

**6. Valuation / Key Risks**

*Market Valuation*

We expect shares to price at the top range of the $16/share IPO price, valuing the company on a fully-diluted basis at \~$513mn. At this valuation, we see tremendous long-term upside if the business is able to execute on its plan (see multiples valuation below)

&#x200B;

|Shares Outstanding (mn)|39.6|
|:-|:-|
|Stock Price ($)|$16.0|
|**Market Cap ($mn)**|**633.6**|
|(+) Net Debt|(120.5)|
|Enterprise Value|**513.1**|

*Multiples Valuation*

While it is difficult to value the business today, we (and Loop) expect the fuel cell market for commercial vehicles to significantly expand in the next few years, with OEMs ramping up production for commercial launch by 2026. The market for fuel cell electric vehicles is expected to grow to \~$7bn in 2026.

Working backwards from this, if Loop grows to a \~$750mn revenue business with 20% EBIT margins (2026 EBIT of $150mn) and a 15x EBIT valuation (in line with current valuation multiples), this would imply a >$2.2bn enterprise value in 2026. Discounting this back to today at a 15% cost of equity still results in >$1.1bn of value, offering >2x upside. We also think this 15x multiple is conservative given the growth potential of the industry and potential for Loop to become a leading market player.

Using this same methodology, 2026E revenue of $200mn - $400mn at a 15x EBIT multiple backs into the $12-$16/share range today.

*Key Risks to Loop’s Valuation*

* Inability to grow business development pipeline with OEMs or translate pipeline into revenue-generating contracts
   * The current pipeline represents $16.4mn, which includes conditional agreements and MOUs; the key focus of the business is expanding on this pipeline
* Existing and new competitors developing a more attractive, more widely adopted product offering
   * While Loop’s positioning is protected by patents, technological advantages, and Cummins backing, OEMs with substantially more capital and may enter the space and compete
* Technological risk of more attractive technology rendering Loop’s technology and offering obsolete
   * Emissions technology continues to advance and there may be a new form of technology that will reach mass-market adoption, replacing hydrogen fuel cells
* Large-scale manufacturing execution
   * While Loop’s management team has experience building out manufacturing, the company (and its competitors) have yet to execute on the large-scale manufacturing required to meet expected future demand

170,1662535603.0,"Porsche IPO is so corrupt that if it goes through, I’m never investing into German stocks again","**TLDR**: the Porsche family is getting full control of Porsche the company literally for free. This is the main reason for the IPO. The way the IPO is structured will hurt VW and gullible investors buying into this. VW and its long-term strategy are thrown into disarray.

**TLDR (with light details):**

1. The Porsche family already owns a significant chunk of both VW and Porsche companies. But they want full control of the Porsche company.
2. They ousted the CEO of VW on a pretext and forced the IPO that benefits only them.
3. The family will get additional 25% of the Porsche, which will give them full control of the company.
4. The family is not paying a market price for 25% stake. In fact, they are not paying at all, because they forced VW to pay a dividend from the IPO proceeds, which the family will get by being a shareholder of VW.
5. Shares available to the public during the IPO are all non-voting.

**Long story**

The way the IPO is organized is a disgrace, and if the German government allows it to go through as is, I will have no faith in making long-term investments in German stocks anymore.

If this is legal under German laws, then I'm not buying. If this is illegal and they don't do anything, I'm not buying either.

To understand what and why is happening you need a little context, so here it is.

The Porsche family lost control of the Porsche company during the 2008 financial crisis. They wanted to buy VW but ended up in a weird financial situation where they instead had to give up control of Porsche to VW but got a controlling voting stake in VW.

The ownership structure is complicated, but in a simplified form it looks like this:

>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company -> Porsche company

The IPO will make it look like this:

>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company (>50% of voting rights)  
>  
>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> Porsche Company (>50% of voting rights)

The money flow is like this:

>The family “buys” 25% of voting shares from VW below market price with no competition.  
>  
>VW pays 50% of IPO proceeds as dividends.  
>  
>The family gets its money back from VW in the form of dividends.

This IPO would be a disaster even during normal times. VW is losing its best cash cow, for half the price, and the price is below market rate. But it’s happening during one of the worst times for IPOs ever. The stocks are in a global downturn, hammered by inflation, rising rates, quantitative tightening, supply chain issues, and ongoing war in Ukraine, which amplified all of the above and added energy crisis on top of that. Germany is in the worst economic situation since the fall of the Berlin wall.

This is not the right time to IPO a luxurious brand. However, this is the best time for the family to get their favorite asset out of VW. From their perspective, the less money IPO makes, the better. This conflict of interests is as bad as it gets.

IPO shares available to the public will be useless non-voting shares for gullible investors, who do not understand what they are buying. Think SNAP or GOOG. But it gets worse.

Let’s remember for a moment, that VW was not a good company for a long while. It ended up in a “diesel gate” scandal, had to pay enormous fines, as well as to change its CEO. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because VW got a good new CEO, had to reinvent itself by becoming more environmentally friendly, and thus started an early transition into EVs.

VW is already a top seller of EVs in Europe and rapidly growing its market share. It has a vast portfolio of cars ranging all segments, from the cheapest economy cars to the most luxurious ones, of which Porsche is the main brand. Platforms within VW are interchangeable, they use the same tech across multiple brands to achieve synergy.

Now, if you take Porsche out, these plans are thrown into disarray. On top of that, both Porsche and VW will have the same CEO, answering to the same family. Which company do you think he will prioritize more when it comes to that?

What’s more, the transition to EVs was not going smooth already. There are issues with software, which VW was never good at historically. And the labor unions were very unhappy at the potential loss of jobs (because you need less jobs to make EVs). The family seized on this opportunity to oust the CEO under a pretext that the software was delayed, and the labor unions supported the change to get their job guarantees.

The labor unions now expect to keep their jobs, meaning VW will have to keep combustion engine factories operating for longer for no economical reason. This is good for workers, but a disaster for investors in VW. The family got their IPO, which is good for them, but also a disaster for investors. And the new CEO has no experience in building software whatsoever with no sound plans to address the problems.

The right change for VW would be to hire an experienced executive VP from one of the major tech companies in the US and improve their software development culture. There was no need to change their CEO, especially considering that VW was transitioning to EVs better than all of its competitors. But, oh well.

**My positions:**

I owned VW stock for a while and sold at \~2x profit after the war in Ukraine started but was planning to buy back later. Now, however, if the IPO goes through, I’m not touching this stock, or any other German stocks for that matter.",Reddit
171,1655484383.0,This Time is Different (2001-2003 v. 2008 v. 2022),"I don't know how many of you are old enough to remember the Tech Bubble or The Great Recession, but I have been alive long enough to remember all of the major market corrections going back to 1973-74.  My contention is that this time is truly different.  Hear me out.

During 2001-2003, while the overall equity markets were down each of the three years, there was still money to be made in commodities, fixed income, and precious metals.

In 2008, which is the worst market of all our lifetimes, one could make money in alternatives, fixed income (especially taxable income), and healthcare.

Even in 1973-74, there was money to be made in T-Bills, T-Bonds, and real estate.

This year has been different. There is money to be made in commodities especially with energy.  The only other sector that has been profitable is agriculture.  What seems to make this different, is that the more traditional hedges against down markets such as fixed income and precious metals have been losers too. The last time we had a market that was down over -20% and the treasury bond index was negative was in 1931. It appears we are in new territory for many of us, including professionals. This is function of rising interest rates from historical lows and an uncertain future for the global economy.  Based on inflationary numbers, every country on this planet is feeling it.

173,1636393373.0,Why have Chinese solar stocks generally not appreciated like rest of the clean energy sector?,"For example, JKS is the largest or 2nd largest solar panel manufacturer in the world with double-digit market share worldwide. It posted revenue of $5.5 billion last year, though with relatively modest earnings at $36 million. But they've managed to keep up with reduction in panel prices surprisingly well over the years. Even with declining panel prices, their revenues are growing. Even if solar panels become a commodity, within 5 years it will be the commodity responsible for more than half of new electricity generation capacity. And as long as solar prices don't crash, they could easily pivot to the business of building solar projects, or start selling electricity.

So how does it make any sense that their market cap is roughly HALF of their annual revenue?

Compare that to TSLA at about 35x the revenue multiple. In the same industry, SPWR is at 5x the revenue multiple. Chinese electric car manufacturer, NIO, it's also trading at around 5x the revenue multiple, and it's not profitable.

So why are *Chinese solar* stocks, in particular, not benefiting form the investment dollars pouring into clean energy sector? And it appears to only be the stocks trading in the US. Those listed in China are faring better.",Reddit
174,1732837477.0,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

179,1734906485.0,Is the Renewable Energy Sector Now Completely Uninvestable? (TAN ICLN),"The renewable energy sector, once seen as a beacon of growth, has recently faced significant headwinds, leading many to question whether it's still a viable investment opportunity.

Key factors to consider:

1. **Policy Shifts & Government Support**: While governments have historically supported clean energy, these policies are becoming increasingly uncertain. The volatility surrounding subsidies, tariffs, and international agreements can significantly affect the outlook for renewable energy investments.
2. **Supply Chain and Production Challenges**: The sector is grappling with major supply chain disruptions, particularly in the production of solar panels and wind turbines. These bottlenecks are pushing up costs and causing delays, which are impacting the profitability of many companies.
3. **Market Volatility**: The renewable energy sector has not seen the consistent growth many had anticipated. External factors such as rising interest rates, inflation, and a challenging global economy have contributed to the sector’s struggles, leaving many investors uncertain about future returns.

That said, some companies remain strong players in the space. *View Holdings* offers a portfolio of companies that are still actively engaged in renewable energy:

* **First Solar Inc** – A leader in solar technology, focused on sustainable energy solutions.
* **Iberdrola S.A.** – A Spanish utility firm investing heavily in renewable energy.
* **SSE Plc** – A key UK utility with a focus on offshore wind projects.
* **Enphase Energy Inc** – Known for its solar microinverters and energy management systems.
* **China Yangtze Power Co** – A utility company with significant renewable energy assets.
* **Vestas Wind Systems AS** – One of the largest wind turbine manufacturers in the world.
* **Chubu Electric Power Co Inc** – A Japanese utility focused on clean energy.
* **EDP Energias de Portugal SA** – A major player in wind and solar energy in Europe.
* **Suzlon Energy Ltd.** – India’s leading renewable energy company.
* **Nextracker Inc** – Specializes in solar tracking systems.

Given the challenges faced by the sector, do you believe renewable energy is still a solid investment, or are the risks too high?

-	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a decline of 34.7%.

The U.S. economy saw the biggest plunge in activity it has ever known in the second quarter, though it wasn't quite as bad as feared.

Gross domestic product from April to June plunged 32.9%, according to the Commerce Department's first reading on the data released Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a drop of 34.7%.

Still, it was the worst drop ever, with the closest previously coming in mid-1921.

Sharp contractions in personal consumption, exports, inventories, investment and spending by state and local governments all converged to bring down GDP, which is the combined tally of all goods and services produced during the period.

Spending slid in health care and goods such as clothing and footwear. Inventory investment drops were led by motor vehicle dealers, while equipment spending and new family housing took hits when it came to investment.

Prices for domestic purchases, a key inflation indicator, fell 1.5% for the period, compared to a 1.4% increase in the first quarter when GDP fell 5%, The personal consumption expenditures price index dropped 1.9% after rising a tepid 1.3% in Q1. Excluding food and energy, the ""core"" PCE prices were off 1.1%.

However, personal income soared, thanks in large part to government transfer payments associated with the coronavorus pandemic. Current-dollar personal income rose more than six-fold to $1.39 trillion, while disposable personal income shot up 42.1% to $1.53 trillion.

Despite the rise, personal outlays tumbled by $1.57 trillion, due in large part to a drop in services spending.

Not the Great Depression nor the Great Recession nor any of the more than three dozen economic slumps over the past two centuries have ever caused such a sharp drain over so short a period of time.

By comparison, the worst quarter during the financial crisis of 2008 was the 8.4% GDP drop in the fourth quarter of that year. The previous low-water mark was a 10% slide in the first quarter of 1958, while the worst in recorded history came in Q2 of 1921.

This particular tumble in activity owes to a different source than any of its predecessors: a government-induced shutdown aimed at combating Covid-19.

Workers across the country were told to stay home from any job not considered essential, resulting in a crushing halt that saw the unemployment rate peak at 14.7%, a post-Depression high.

However Energy transition sources grow only 0.4% per  year: Turns out I can't post URLs so don't know how to cite this.

There's also the real possibility that green-energy is energy-negative. Meaning it takes more energy to mine the copper, the steel, the materials that go into producing green energy than energy it returns.

Even oil is mostly energy negative; the last energy positive well was discovered in 1970s if I remember correctly.

Therefore it has been my suspicion that at first the Energy Transition was really a way of creating ""batteries"" to save as much energy as we could with the technology at the time in order to stave off an energy crisis. Imagine if you will, taking an X amount of energy and then using it to build an energy producing product at 0.9X. That decay is much slower than simply burning it out of a tail pipe.

Proterra is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **ACTC.** A [press statement](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Proterra-Release.pdf) released on January 12th, 2021 suggests that the merger is ""expected to close in the first half of 2021"". There is some speculation regarding the date; they’ve already filed the S-4, so the timeline for merger vote looks to be around end of March to April first week according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/le6yur/proterra_actc_merger/) and [the SEC website.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1820630&owner=exclude)

# Financials and Fundamentals

**All data derived from SEC forms and the** [investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

* **2025E EBITDA:** 21%
* **2025E Free Cash Flow:** $390MM
* **'20E-'25E CAGR:** 68% (Peer median 37%)
* **'22E-'25E Scaling Gross Margins:** 13-25% (Peer median 23%)
* **'21E Valuation:** 6.5x (Peer median 16.2x)
* **'22E Valuation:** 3.6x (Peer median 10.3x)
* These are very attractive valuations considering the growth compared to peers.
* **Trading Median (as of January 2021):** 1.6 transaction value/trading value (Trading median 3.1)
* **Revenue '21E:** $246MM (Peer median $120MM)
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Traded Mobility Tech Leaders:** $4.7Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Mobility SPAC Transactions:** $4.3Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Proterra:** $1.6Bn

**Let's do a little evaluating ourselves:**

**Shares outstanding post-merger:** 240.1MM

**Based on January ACTC prices pre NASDAQ sell-off:** $24/share

* 240.1MM \* $24/share = 5.76Bn Market Cap
* Let's find Proterra's value here without the SPAC shenanigans.
* 5.76Bn - $852MM = 4.91Bn Market Cap without SPAC cash
* 2022E estimated revenue is 439M
* 2022E adjusted .7561 for present value is 332M
* So unadjusted EV/Rev = 11.18
* And adjusted EV/Rev = 14.78
* Competitor EV/Rev = 10.3x on average for 2022E
* Proterra claims an 84% premium
* 1.84 \* 10.3 = 18.95
* So the industry metric is 18.95x.

**UNADJUSTED:**

* 439 unadjusted x 18.9 = 8.3B
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $9.162Bn unadjusted market cap
* 9.162/240.1 = **$38.16 unadjusted**
* 9.162Bn - 5.76Bn = **3.402Bn undervalued**

**ADJUSTED:**

* 332 \* 18.9 = 6.274Bn
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $7.126Bn adjusted market cap
* 7.126/240.1 = **$29.58 adjusted**
* 7.126 - 5.76 = **$1.366Bn undervalued**

**Average between adjusted and unadjusted:**

* Dollar value: $2.384Bn undervalued
* **Fair share price: $33.87**

[Here is another analyst finding it undervalued in a similar way on Feb 10th.](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/actc-stock-arclight-spac-merger-proterra-undervalued/)

*Let's think about that for a moment...*

As of this writing ACTC is trading at $15.65, based on purely fundamentals without speculation it is trading **116.42% below it's actual value.**

# Conclusion

Proterra is not only the most undervalued stock on the entire market, it's also positioned to be one of the best performing companies over the next several years. With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10 years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding post-merger which is expected to happen end of March-first week in April (although the official statement is ""the first half of this year""). 

The company is currently undervalued by 116.42% on fundamentals alone, and that's on the ""fair"" end. When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.

**Bear Case:** I literally can't think of one aside from the merger falling apart. If someone could provide a bear case in the comments for Proterra (assuming the merger is successful) I would love to discuss it, because either I'm missing something glaringly obvious or this might be my greatest pick.

**How to Play?**

I am long on this with my shares. I will be holding all my shares for several years, my calls I will exercise half after the merger and sell the rest for a nice profit. If you want to just play the merger that's an option too. Meaning just hold until the merger date and sell at whatever you think the peak is that very day.

1. Buy shares, ACTC will change to PTRA after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
2. Warrants, ACTCW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
3. Calls, I think virtually anything listed is going to print (aside from 03/19)
4. Selling puts, the premiums are hefty so either you'll get a nice premium or you'll own some shares at a really nice discount.

**Positions:**

3,865 shares @ 22.37

10C 04/16 $20.00

12C 05/21 $22.50

17C 05/21 $25.00

6C 08/20 $35

**TL;DR:** Fundamental's alone show this company is already **116.42% undervalued**, factor in hype, forward-thinking, IPO, etc. and I can't even come up with a PT. I would *expect* a PT post-merger to travel upwards to \~$50-$60 and settle back down no lower than $34. EOY my prediction is \~$70-$80. 2025 prediction is \~$300-$500. I recommend you read. I wouldn't want to gloss this one over if I were you. If you prefer you could simply check out [their investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf) 

**EDIT:** The 10.3 factor is from an EV basket that includes many direct and indirect competitors. The list is in the presentation. 

**EDIT 2:** This is a fundamental DD. There are a lot of comments regarding other competitors not mentioned. Most of the companies not mentioned were including in the 10.3 factor for diversity. A lot of these competitors being mentioned are bus manufacturers, Proterra is a fleet level ecosystem infrastructure provider. They don’t just make buses. 

**EDIT 3:** Fair warning, even though Proterra is significantly undervalued, there are other market mechanics at play. With the NASDAQ sell off its uncertain how much lower ACTC will go if at all. I think this is an excellent play, now you just need excellent timing.

**EDIT4:** Added “2025E” to EDIBTA

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nothing I ever say or do is a financial recommendation. Any words urging someone to do something is only going as far as suggesting they do their own DD, it is in no way an attempt to convince anyone to make any financial decisions. Plus...this thing doesn't need to get pumped. I'm just trying to share the find.*",Reddit
