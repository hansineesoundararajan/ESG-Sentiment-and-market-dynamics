The US Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months two people familiar with the matter told Reuters

The Nvidia and AMD machine to be called Polaris will not be a replacement for the Intelbased Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago which was poised to be the nations fastest computer when announced in 2019

Instead Polaris which will come online this year will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine the people familiar with the matter said

A more technical breakdown can be found from the DOEs labs websitehttpswwanlgovarticleusdepartmentofenergysargonnenationallaboratoryandhewlettpackardenterprisepreparefor

To be clear the Intel deal is merely delayed but not canceled How does this change the narrative of NvdaAMD versus Intel in the highend server and super computer space Are these kind of delays very common IE Its not a big deal

Or did Intel just messed up a very visible and prestigious deal that will accelerate nvdaamds surge to capture Intel market share

Roughly two years ago I found a really nice investment opportunity guaranteed minimum 10 annual ROI over the course of 5 years in wooden pellets through Serge Energy a company based in Finland 

I was a bit skeptical so I did a ton of googling around and decided  to eventually go for it

The amount I invested was fairly small lets say 5k

Over the last two years everything has seemed fine and normal 

My account manager calls me every couple of months 610 to let me know how the market prices are considering the price of pellets started spiking due to the invasion of Ukraine

I received a few emails with additional investment opportunities most of them with a ROI of 1215 per year but it didnt really seem anything out of the ordinary considering the price of pellets had been soaring so fast that those values were still below the selling market value

I received an invitation to a event in Helsinki at the HQ regarding future investment opportunities I didnt go but it all seemed fine

Roughly a week ago I received a more curious email Not from my account manager but from two Asset Growth Executives their title in the signature of the email

The email basically states that they found a number of birch trees on my patch of land the one used to produce wooden pellets and that this is a great financial turn since these can be turned into sheets of Veneer which will be sold for roughly 5x my initial investment and the payout of this process will be in 3 months from now And the process of pellets will keep running but the payout will be delayed a year

For this to go forward I would need to do an additional payment of roughly 40 the initial investment value which once again is a fairly low value to pay for the processing fees of the third party company who handles the wood Serge Energy would also keep their usual 10 of the sale price of the veneer sheets

So in short is this legit 

Everything I google regarding the company comes out as being legit and I was fairly confident they were legit up until now  since this really seems too good to be true

Now we come to stagflation Oil went from 28 a barrel in December 1973 to  63 in January of 1974  just a month later The historical high price of oil was 32 in 1948 To put this in modern terms it would be like oil hitting 300 a barrel by midJuly from 120 now This energy shock is what caused the twin pillagers of economic stagnation they laid me off and inflation it costs me how much to fill up my tank The problem was not bad monetary policy in 1973 I mean it might have been bad but  it didnt matter much at all compared to the overnight explosion of prices in the necessary commodity that underpinned the global economy from food to airplanes I really must emphasize the food point without tractors and gas we cant feed 98 of the world with only 2 working the fields Minus fossil fuels that ratio flips  you need 98 of the population farming to feed the lucky 2 who can have a different job Thats what made the medieval era different 

Why did oil skyrocket like that Because Americas support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war of 1973 led to the OPEC oil embargohttpswwfederalreservehistoryorgessaysoilshockof197374 As we are learning now if an oil cartel decides to pick a side in a war they can take a pound of flesh Though Russia is only a fraction as dominant now as OPEC was then 

Ive seen folks debating whether Volkers deflationary and merciless interest rate hikes helped lower demand enough Ive seen folks suggest Reagans inflationary and optimistic tax cuts somehow voodooed the economic back into shape Both are efforts to paint the target on top of the bullet holes already in the wall Oil peaked in May of 1980 and dropped off a cliff in January 1986 The reason for that collapse Saudi Arabia wanted to take more market share and increased productionhttpswwbrookingseduwpcontentuploads1986061986bbpeagatelyadelmangriffinpdf The lesson of stagflation isnt some cautionary tale about monetary policy Its about the price of energy full stop Preventing Volker or Reagan had anything to do with it more than on the margins is just an exercise in comfort  its nice to think that we can choose leaders who might fix something In reality they are all riding the same elephant and they arent the ones telling it what to do Some however do a better job of convincing others that they are in charge

A pellet of uranium the size of a finger nail can create the same amount of energy as 1 ton of coal or 150 gallons of oil Roughly 1 MWh of electricity 

The nuclear lifecycle creates minimal carbon emissions And its 0 carbon emissions while actually producing the electricity All of the carbon emissions come from mining fuel processing construction and waste management Its on par with wind energy for lifecycle emissions without the drawback of being an intermittent form of energy 

For some context here nuclear energy produces 315 gCO2kWh across the lifecycle while natural gas produces 400500 gCO2kWh 

An unfortunate realization Ive come to regarding the performance of nuclear energy stocks is that theyre heavily dependent on the performance of tech companies specifically AI Friday and today saw widespread declines across nuclear energy stocks because Microsoft noted less demand than they originally thought for new data centers

President Joe Biden is expected to hold a video conference call with the leaders of France Germany and the United Kingdom on Monday as his administration continues to seek their support for a ban on the imports

The White House is also negotiating with congressional leaders who are working on fasttracking legislation banning Russian imports a move that is forcing the administration to work on an expedited timeline a source told Reuters

A senior US official told Reuters that no final decision has been made but it is likely just the US if it happens

Oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the United States and European allies consider banning Russian imports

Europe relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products read more The United States relies far less on Russian crude and products but a ban would help drive prices up and pinch US consumers already seeing historic prices at the gas pump read more

US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Sunday letter that her chamber is exploring legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week 10 billion in aid for Ukraine in response to Moscows military invasion of its neighbor

A bipartisan group of US senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban US imports of Russian oil The bill is getting fasttracked

After Russia invaded Ukraine the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russias refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline which has never launched

So far it has stopped short of targeting Russias oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and US energy prices

Asked if the United States has ruled out banning Russian oil imports unilaterally US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday said Im not going to rule out taking action one way or another irrespective of what they do but everything weve done the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners Blinken said

At the same time the White House did not deny that Biden might make a trip to Saudi Arabia as the United States seeks to get Riyadh to increase energy production Axios reported that such a trip was a possibility

This is premature speculation and no trip is planned a White House official said

A year ago Biden shifted US policy away from a focus on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who is considered by many to be the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85yearold King Salman

The consumer price index a  wideranging measure of goods and services prices increased even more  than the 83 Dow Jones estimate Excluding volatile food and energy  prices socalled core CPI was up 6 slightly higher than the 59  estimate

On a monthly basis headline CPI was up 1 while core rose 06 compared to respective estimates of 07 and 05

Surging shelter gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase

Energy  prices broadly rose 39 from a month ago bringing the annual gain to  346 Within the category fuel oil posted a 169 monthly gain  pushing the 12month surge to 1067

Shelter costs which account  for about a onethird weighting on the CPI rose 06 for the month  the fastest onemonth gain since March 2004 The 55 12month gain is  the most since February 1991

Finally food costs climbed another 12 in May bringing the yearoveryear gain to 101

Those  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 06 in April even though  average hourly earnings rose 03 On a 12month basis real average  hourly earnings were down 3

Unlike the 201718 rise of Bitcoin the 202021 Bitcoin price action has been largely driven and influenced by institutional demand

With institutional demand comes institutional products We have seen bitcoin derivatives bitcoin trusts and more recently a new way for exposure to bitcoin price action publicly traded bitcoin mining companies

There are two bitcoin mining companies which Id like to review for you here Both trade on Nasdaq they are RIOThttpswwtradingviewcomsymbolsNASDAQRIOT and MARAhttpswwtradingviewcomsymbolsNASDAQMARA

Lets begin with a quick summary on bitcoin mining



 What is Bitcoin Mining

To mine a new block on the bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a noncehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBitcoinMining The cryptographic combination of the nonce  next block content must be numerically smaller than the networks difficulty target more on this below Generating a new nonce is extremely computationally expensive There is no shortcut miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result They are trying to find the answer to a math problem a nonce that hashes correctly with the SHA256httpsenwikipediaorgwikiSHA2 cryptographical hashing function

The bitcoin network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks This is called the difficultyhttpswwblockchaincomchartsdifficulty The aim is to have a new block mined approximately every 10 minutes This means that if the mining power is doubled the difficulty is made 2x harder Double the energy for the same amount of bitcoin

We can see an estimate for the total hash rate being applied to the bitcoin network todayhttpswwblockchaincomchartshashrate  Notice that it is about 150m THs right now 150 million trillion nonces tried every second So for every block every 10 minutes 91022 attempts are done 90 sextillion until one lucky participant finds a valid nonce and can mine the next bitcoin block In doing so they get rewarded 625 newly generated bitcoin  some bitcoin in transaction fees from users of the network

You can run code on your computer to try and find the next bitcoin block In fact this is how all bitcoin mining used to be done However these days you will end up spending more on electricity than you mine in bitcoin This is because people have developed special ASIC chips designed specially for brute forcing the SHA256 function These chips are a factor of 100 times more efficient than your computer



 Mining on an ASIC Bitcoin Miner

The biggest producer of ASIC Bitcoin Miners is a Chinese company called BitmainhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBitmain They produce miners run many of the miners and even run many mining poolshttpsantpoolcom where people can collectively search for the next block and split the profits

Bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in bitcoin This is because there is a lag while new bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture excess profit

So lets take a look at how profitable it is to run an ASIC miner today

The Antminer S19 Prohttpsshopbitmaincomproductdetailpid002020122165500548JAa69Gvu067A is one of Bitmains latest machines  It can run an impressive 110 THs and uses 3250W of power On their website Bitmain is listing them at 3769 per machine but in bulk companies can buy them for as low as 233 notice they are sold out until at least August

So

 233 machine cost
 Using 008kWh electricity costs benchmark for electricity cost in Chinahttpswwovoenergycomguidesenergyguidesaverageelectricitypriceskwhhtml we get 325kW  008  026 per hour in electricity costs Assuming we run 247 this gives us 026  24  365  2278 in electricity costs per year
 And how many bitcoin will we mine Well at 110 Ths on an ASIC machine we are capturing 1101500000  000733 of the total bitcoin network per machine at current total hash rate 52560 bitcoin blocks mined per year 625 bitcoin reward per block  125 bitcoin in transaction fees avg right now  75 bitcoin per block  52560 blocks  3942k bitcoin per year for the entire network 000733 of this is 0289 bitcoin per machine per year  14450 revenue at 50k per bitcoin
 14450  2278  122k profit per year

You can play with the parameters to figure out different profit levels For example if the total hash rate doubled to 300m Ths profit per machine would drop to 5k per year

Also note that transaction fees fluctuate over time depending on how many people are actually using bitcoin sending and receiving transactions See historic transaction feeshttpswwblockchaincomchartstransactionfees 

And how long can you run a machine for

Running so many calculations slows a machine quickly Additionally new faster hardware is introduced making past hardware unprofitable fairly quickly As a rule of thumb we can expect a machine to be profitable for about 2 years This is also the rate at which companies mark the depreciation of miners on their balance sheet

In Year 2 the machines become much less profitable than initially

There have been studies to see where bitcoin mining is occurring through IP address analysis of miners working in pools The University of Cambridge has a realtime maphttpscbeciorgminingmap in which we can see that in 2020 mining was

 Country  	  Total Hash Rate 	
		
 China  	 69  	
 Russia  	 6  	
 US  	 5  	
 Kazakhstan 	 5  	
 Malaysia  	 4  	
 Iran  	 4  	



 RIOT and MARA

Now that we have a basic overview of how bitcoin mining works lets look our new investment phenomenon publicly traded NASDAQ listed bitcoin mining companies

 RIOT

Incorporated in July 200 the company was renamed to Riot Blockchain in October 2017 The company now exclusively mines bitcoin and has a partnership with Coinmint LLC in New York who operate the miners RIOT was a penny stock for most of its existence and was irrelevant until mid 2020

How many miners do they have

 Current status of preDec 2020 orders 115k miners in operation and 10k more to be deliveredhttpswwriotblockchaincomnewsmediapressreleasesdetail99riotblockchainachievesmilestoneof1ehsinhashrate funded from 100m secondary offering in Oct 2020httpswwsecgovArchivesedgardata1167419001079973200871riots3htm
 In December 2020 their stock price rocketed alongside bitcoin 315 in 15 months They took advantage of this and ran a secondary offering raising 200mhttpswwsecgovArchivesedgardata11674190010799732001054riots3htm With this money they ordered 15k more miners for 35mhttpswwsecgovArchivesedgardata11674190010799732001096ex99x1htm Expected delivery starts in May 2021 with the bulk to be delivered in October 2021

Summary 37640 machines at full deployment 115k machines today and wont be running the rest until Q3Q4

So ignoring the cost of the machines

 Operational 115k machines at 122k profit per year per machine  137m
 Full capacity Q3Q4 376k machine at 122k profit per year per machine  459m

And assets

 Maybe 150m in cashbtc left over from secondary offering and past assets


Note They may get cheaper electricity costs through their partnership and claim as low as 0014 per kwh in some releases


 MARA

Incorporated in 2010 the company has a wild history It first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium then real estate in Southern California and most recently patent trolling The company has some questionable leadership and has also been a penny stock for most of its existence In 2019 I think the company began delving into bitcoin mining

In September 2019 they purchased 6k S9 Bitmain miners 135 THs for 4m Notice that at 135 THs these machines are far from profitable today Im not even sure they were profitable back then

So more recently they own

 Current status of preDec 2020 orders 65k miners in operation and 30k more to be deliveredhttpswwmarathonpgcomnewspressreleasesdetail1226bitmainships400antminers19proasicminersto funded from 100m secondary offering in Aug 2020httpswwsecgovArchivesedgardata150760500149315220014870forms3htm
 In December 2020 ran another secondary offering after their stock price went from 214 in a month They raised 200mhttpswwsecgovArchivesedgardata150760500149315220023410forms3htm With this money they ordered 70k more miners delivery of 7k in July 63k in December for 168m
 In January 2021 they ran yet another secondary offering raising 300m morehttpswwsecgovArchivesedgardata15076050014931522100864forms3asrhtm They used 150m of this to buy 48k bitcoin at 31k per coin

Summary

 Operational 65k miners  79m per yr
 Full capacity Dec 2021 103k miners  125bn per yr

They also made 90m on their bitcoin holdings so far 150m  240m

Impressive numbers right Well



 Too good to be true

So what are RIOT and MARA trading at you may ask

With the recent jump of bitcoin to 50k RIOT and MARA have rocketed

 RIOT closed at 7790 per share a market cap of 53bn
 MARA closed at 4790 per share a market cap of 45bn

Investor euphoria is at all time highs So much so that their price action has rapidly outpacedhttpsiimgurcomVjQTaA3png and divergedhttpsiimgurcomwwzoTn6png from bitcoin

So is it because they have such huge potential If RIOT gets all of its hardware delivered is it really going to be making 459m per year And MARA 125bn per year

Well probably not

 As bitcoin price goes up mining becomes VERY profitable and there is a rush to build and deploy more hardware From Oct to Dec 2017 the price of bitcoin famously went from 4k to 20k Total hash rate went up about 60 during this time However it went up a massive 600 over the following 9 months as new miners were produced and deployedhttpswwblockchaincomchartsdifficulty with a lag
 As the price of bitcoin capped out and then dipped mining soon became unprofitable at such a high total hash rate and miners lost a lot of money
 Both RIOT and MARA are pending receipt of the majority of their miners and wont be taking delivery until late 2021early 2022 What will the networks total hash rate be by then What will bitcoin price be by then Chinese miners wont be sitting by idle
 And we ignored the cost of the machines In the future RIOT and MARA will need to buy new machines Regardless of the market the old ASIC miners will quickly trend towards unprofitability Bitcoin is closed system There will only be a maximum of 3285k  tx fees of bitcoin mined per year In fact this will reduce in 2024 with the next halving A company cannot reliably mine more bitcoincapture more of the network because if they are finding it profitable to increase their hash rate then you can be certain every other miner is doing the same How many 100m secondary offerings can they do for this free lunch
 Take a look at the past financials of these companieshttpswwsecgovixdocArchivesedgardata1167419001079973200948riot10qq30920htm RIOT mined an impressive 24m worth of bitcoin in Q3 2020 Their costs were 13m in electricityrentetc  12m depreciation 25m Once you add in their 2m of salaries and marketing they had an operating loss of 21m for the quarter Their bitcoin did appreciate by a cool 385k meaning their net loss for the quarter ended at 17m
 Of course their next quarter should look wildly better thanks to bitcoins Q4 2020 price action But this is not a business that is massively profitable under normal market conditions


The bull case

 Bitcoin keeps rocketing and never comes back The total hash rate doesnt catch up and 50k btc becomes 1m btc MARAs 125bn revenue next year becomes 125bn before ASIC miner production catches up Investors doubled their money


Of course if it becomes so profitable one wonders if Bitmain decides it is better value to use the miners themselves and breach their contract



 Tobins Q

Simply stated when you invest in a RIOT or MARA you are investing in the profitabilityunprofitability of bitcoin mining over the next 12 years

It could be hugely profitable or it could crash and burn like it did in 2018 and you see no returns

In this instance you are paying the executive team of MARA and RIOT to buy the hardware plug it in and sell any bitcoin for you There isnt much more to it than that  you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity

So perhaps a good way to see what kind of premium you are paying to own bitcoin miner exposure through these NASDAQ companies is the Q RatiohttpsenwikipediaorgwikiTobin27sq The Q ratio is the market cap of the company divided by the replacement costs of its assets

RIOT

 Market Cap 53bn
 Current btc miners 115k 27m
 Ordered btc miners 26k 60m
 150m cash remaining guess
 A whopping Q ratio of 224 And 63 of that is cash 25 in orders

MARA

 Market Cap 45bn
 Current btc miners 65k 15m
 Ordered btc miners 965k 225m
 240m in bitcoin
 100m cash remaining guess
 A value Q ratio of 775

With this approach RIOT is trading at a 224x premium today and MARA a 775x

A criticism of this valuation methodology may be that it is justified paying a premium when orders for new hardware are so backlogged Just remember that these companies are also stuck in that backlog and wont have most of their machines online until 2022 Is it really worth such a premium



 Other factors to consider

These companies have questionable management The CEO of MARA has awarded himself compensation in excess of 300mhttpswwsecgovArchivesedgardata15076050014931522100469form8khtm over the last few months Realise that the market cap of MARA was less than 300m just 3 months ago

Both companies are quick to do secondary offering after secondary offering at such high prices MARA has been more aggressive recently and the downward pressure of insider selling and secondary share offerings has resulted in the price moving from 2048 in the time RIOT has gone from 2077

A read through both of their 10Qs will give you paragraphs of legal claims shareholder class actions and past investment writeoffs due to corruptionshady circumstances

These companies have no moat They have no IP They have no key talent hires They are simply ordering ASIC miners plugging them in and having the biggest paydays of their lives



 Trading strategies

So is there a trading strategy I would recommend

 Bear

The challenge with being a bear in this market is you have to seriously consider whether the riskreward is there for betting on the downside

Right now the market doesnt care for your fundamentals Bitcoin has passed 50k the narrative is that its going to 100k The market expects these stocks to continue to trade at multiples and be 10x higher in a month

It sounds ridiculous but it keeps happening It is far too dangerous to be short these stocks Or worse short calls and you could be bankrupt on 1 intraday move

So that leaves you with puts Average implied vol nearing 300 does not make them cheap

If you truly have conviction that there will be a correction in the near term then consider weekly bear spreads

Longer DTE plays are insanely expensive and run the risk of the many secondary offerings eventually justifying a price higher than your price target

Another interesting idea would be a relative trade If you could find exposure to bitcoin mining at 20x premium your long run earnings could net out However all publicly traded companies are similarly ludicrous so youd have to buy a stake in btc mining privately or try and own some ASIC miners yourself

More simply you could go long bitcoin and short RIOTMARA This should converge in the long run The risk is that short term the short position will be impossible to risk manage and there is always the risk of more secondary offerings


 Bull

Buy as far OTM weekly calls as you can at 400 IV and hope that momentum market continues Fundamentals are for the 2010s



 Other

Both RIOT and MARAs stock price spent some time consolidating down from 28 to the 1622 range when bitcoin corrected back from its initial 45k run up back to to 30k

It is possible they will again if bitcoin has a pullback However the price action of these stocks has diverged even from bitcoin for the time being

Ultimately the price action we are seeing now is purely momentumhypetechnical and probably retail driven Long term and as far as future earnings go this play is a loser But be careful that doesnt seem to matter right now

 The consumer price index which measures the cost of a wideranging basket of goods and services rose 08 for the month good for a 68 pace on a year over year basis and the fastest rate since June 1982

 Excluding food and energy prices socalled core CPI was up 05 for the month and 49 from a year ago which itself was the sharpest pickup since mid1991

Shelter costs came in at 38

 Shelter costs which comprise about onethird of the CPI increased 38 on the year the highest since 2007 as the housing crisis accelerated

An interesting observation was made in this commenthttpswwredditcomrEconomicscommentsrd8rjninflationsurged68evenmorethanexpectedinhnzk9o9 about this

This is my first time posting here so I appreciate any helpful comments 

Ive been investing since 2019 and recently have gotten back into it after a long hiatus Ive invested in some standard ETFs like VOO IGM etc and am now looking to diversify my portfolio and develop a long term strategy

As a personal advocate of the merits of nuclear energy I wanted to garner some opinions on the outlook of nuclear power andor the uranium mining industry Ive read some past posts on this sub and the general sentiment seems to be lukewarm that it may play out long term but its a relatively mixed bag at this point So far my watchlist is comprised of

 NUKZ
 NLR
 NXE
 CCJ
 UEC
 UROY

Since Ive read a good amount of opinions from past posts on this sub I wanted to ask more specifically for where I can access good resources to read updates projections and general trends in the nuclear energy sector Any help is appreciated thanks so much",Reddit,"[{'entity_group': 'DATE', 'score': 0.97000086, 'word': '2019', 'start': 111, 'end': 115}]",0,0.9833
141,141,1586105325.0,"One reason why bear markets lose steam as they continue, and why energy tanking on Monday will matter less than you think","Certain sectors get hit harder in various recessions and some always get hit hard in all recessions consumer cyclical for example but as these sectors decline they become a smaller and smaller piece of the SP500 pie by market cap  So if Energy was 5 of the SP prior to the downturn and gets cut in half thats 25 off of the overall index  But now if it gets cut in half again its only 125 off the overall index

Same with all the physical retail thats getting pummeled right now  Look at the market caps of all these companies if you combine the market caps of all physical retailers together it doesnt even add up to an Amazon Microsoft or Google  Those companies were already the driving force behind the market and after this decline they are even more so the driving forces

145,145,1611493796.0,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"Whats up everyone I created an algo that scans the most popular trading subreddits and logs the tickers mentioned in duediligence or discussionstyled posts Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment I logged how popular the post was among the subreddit Essentially if it makes it to the hot page then it will most likely be on this list There are two parts to this post The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading subreddits such as this one and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB subreddit

How can I use this list

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending As an example I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs or even Palantir until they started trending on Reddit This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker Ive taken the most popular post for that ticker on whichever subreddit it may have been What Ive found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one subreddit then generallyspeaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other subreddits Heres the data from the last week

146,146,1747232296.0,Why aren’t Treasury investors sounding the alarm about the Tax Cut extension?,"Congress has released draft legislative text for extending the 2017 tax cuts The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the proposed legislation would add 56 trillion to the deficit over the next decade to be offset by 19 trillion in spending reductions for a net cost of 37 trillion Source httpsthehillcombusinessbudget5297588republicanstaxbilljctamp 

This is on top of a national debt figure thats already projected to rise above 50 trillion by the end of this decade without new fiscally expansionary legislation being passed

Some Republicans representing battleground states have criticized the proposed spending reductions mainly to lowerincome social welfare programs  clean energy incentives as being politically unpalatable Historically when this happens congressional leadership tends to trim down some of the cuts  throw the cost onto the deficit because these battleground legislators are on the front lines of deciding which party wins the majority

Even the draft 37T cost would be by far the most expensive legislation ever passed exceeding the 2020 CARES Act the 2021 Rescue Plan and the 2022 Inflation Reduction EV incentives Act And its unlikely to be a large stimulus to economic growth considering that most of the bill simply extends the 2017 tax reform although there are some targeted new provisions like no tax on tips etc

Three years ago when Liz Truss proposed big and largelyunfunded tax cuts in the UK bond investors sent Gilt yields soaring from 35 to 5 requiring the Bank of England to intervene Truss resigned as Prime Minister after only 45 days and she lost her Parliament seat in the next election

Meanwhile Treasury investors have remained calm 10year yields have settled around 45 in the last few days and in fact are slightly lower today They dont seem to be alarmed by the exponential growth in deficits  the national debt What explains this

155,155,1610598776.0,[DD] 12k on NextEra Energy (NEE) LEAPs as a clean energy play,"I  wasnt really planning on making a post on this but Id like to make the case for investing in a utilities company focused on clean energy as a smart play for the upcoming stimulusshift towards renewables

So whats NextEra Energy Summarized from Wikipedia

 It is the largest electric utility in the USA by market capitalization At 160B currently
 Revenues of over 1920 billion in 2019 Operating income of 535 billion in 2019
 About 1400 employees throughout the US and Canada
 The important subsidiaries include
   The Utilities
   Florida Power  Light FPL  A Florida electric utility Notable for having wider profit margins than usual
   Gulf Power Company  Electric utility in the Alabama area
   NextEra Energy Capital Holdings NEECH
   NextEra  Energy Resources NEER  The largest operators of wind and solar  projects in the world Importantly expansive holdings in the Midwest  Also has numerous energy storage projects under their belt
 They also have a 35 stake in NextEra Energy Partners NEP with Jim Robo being the CEO of both companies

In  fact Ill just direct you to NextEras IR page because for some  reason theyve placed a very solid series of pages outlining their  financial health where almost nobody will find themhttpwwinvestornexteraenergycomfixedincomeinvestorsfinancialpolicy You can flip  through the Policy Strength FundingCapital Structure Cash  FlowLeverage and Liquidity pages there at your leisure to understand  more about the company But basically theyre extremely healthy as a  company Notably theyve been unwinding positions for cashhttpwwinvestornexteraenergycomnewsandeventsnewsreleases20201102202022338600 recently despite their solid balance sheet

Now  Id like to point out their PE 41 Yup this is a boring utility company trading at 41x PE after running up 200 in 5 years and 80 in  2 For reference Microsoft is trading at 3490 PE As far as utilities  go I think its fair to say these guys are as far from boring as it  gets

Summary of the fundamentals

1 Management is extremely reliable
2 Theyre the market leader in renewables deployment
3 Theyve proven they know how to compete and edge out profits in cutthroat industries
4 High PE but in a stable industry
5 They have plenty of leverage available for massive capital expenditures

Now  onto why I think they will collect more than their fair share of  Bidens upcoming stimulus Lets start off by looking at what Biden has  been pushing in his announcements

1 Pushing the environmental costs onto polluters
2 Pushing renewables directly
3 Creating longterm middle class union jobs

Among utilities NextEra stands out as an early and consistent investor in renewableshttpwwinvestornexteraenergycomnewsandeventsnewsreleases202012112020173514490 Straight from the link above

According  to SP Global Trucost NextEra Energy ranked ahead of its peers on a  number of impressive reported performance metrics among others  including signed contracts to build approximately 1200 megawatts of  additional wind solar and battery storage projects as of the close of  2019 and NextEra Energys announced target of emissions reductions per  unit of generation by 67 by 2025 from a 2005 baseline equivalent to a  40 reduction in absolute emissions  and this despite an expected  doubling of generation over the period Already NextEra Energy reports  more than 50 of its generation is from zero and nearzeroemitting  sources

I think its fair to say that point 1 will hurt them much less than it will their less progressive competition

Additionally  as a result of their investments so far theyre not untested when it  comes to deployment They know what to expect and we know they can  execute on larger CapEx programs with less risk than the competition If  Biden is to throw the expected 40 billion a year into the industry  its quite likely NextEra will be ready to scale up operations  sustainably and successfully to capitalize on the opportunity clearing  point two

But point three is the  really interesting one Let me start off with a question If you were a  democratic president that wanted to create middleclass jobs in  renewables how would you go about it Would you invest in the companies  making the end product Maybe a little for the companies that pull the  required resources out of the ground too

Lets  take a look at what the clean energy portion stimulus bill a few weeks  ago contained and see how NextEra is positioned for each portionhttpswwredditcomrinvestingcommentskhx7ebstimulusbillincludes35billionforclean Big thanks to umillerlithttpswwredditcomumillerlit for summarizing Also Ill be referencing the NextEra 2019 annual report from this point onhttpwwinvestornexteraenergycomreportsandfilingsannualreports Please bring up a copy if youd like to verify the numbers I claim

 15 Billion for Solar  Will probably go to most industry players pretty  equally NextEra will get a cut as a result of their investing through NEER 12 of NEERs generation is from solar power according to the 2019 annual report p13
 26 Billion for Transport  NextEra probably wont get much of this but they have made an acquisitionhttpwwinvestornexteraenergycomnewsandeventsnewsreleases202012082020123104618 in the field within the last month It would be a nice perk if they  announced major projects here but lets just leave this as a  hypothetical
 17 billion for a Weatherization Assistance Program  Im not 100 sure how  theyll break this down but up here in Canada they do these programs  as rebates through utility providers NextEra is almost definitely going to get a cut of this as far as I can seehttpswwfplcomsaveprogramshtml
 108 billion for shortterm longterm seasonal and transportation energy  storage technologies  NextEra is pretty big in the battery storage  field I dont think theyll be the ones developing a new battery chemistry but theyre definitely a serious userhttpswwgreentechmediacomarticlesreadnexteraenergytospend1bonenergystorageprojectsin2021
 236 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies   Theyre going to get a serious cut of this for obvious reasons
 625  million for new research development and commercialization for both  onshore and offshore wind technologies  65 of NEERs renewables  generation is wind power according to the 2019 annual report Theyre  going to get a nice cut here too
 850 million for geothermal technology development  Nothing here will go to NextEra as far as Im aware
 1093 million for marine energy and hydropower tech  Nothing here will go to NextEra as far as Im aware
 500 million pot for industry and transportation looking to decarbonize  0 stake in this race
 62  billion for carbon capture utilization and storage technologies  FPL  is investing quite heavily here as 74 of their generation back in 2019  was from Natural Gas p9 Theyre going to get a good portion of  this
 66  billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power  plants and the development of advanced reactors  FPL generated 22 of  their power from Nuclear in 2019 p9 Theyre probably going to get a  fair slice of this
 47 billion for fusion industry  NextEra isnt spending money on fusion development as far as Im aware
 Looser  regulations for using government land for renewables  A nice gesture  to drop land costs by increasing supply for sustainable uses Heres a map of US public land so you can take a lookhttpsuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb00fUSfederallandagenciessvg1280pxUSfederallandagenciessvgpng

But you get the point by now  NextEra has a slice in a lot of these pies directly On top of that the renewables segment as a whole is going to hugely benefit from the stimulus driving down the capital expenditures required for panels and turbines Frankly there are very few people  better positioned than a wellrun utility company with massive credit  available taking on the debt at great rates When I put it like that its no surprise that these folks managed to thrive under Trumps policies  and that theyre extremely well positioned to grow aggressively under Biden

But theres even a fun political trap for the republicans here Do you know  where the best place to place onshore wind turbines is The midwesthttpswwnistgovsitesdefaultfilesimagesitlsedgsgmri502mphincgumbelv2png Sourcehttpswwnistgovprogramsprojectsmapsnonhurricanenontornadicextremewindspeedscontiguousunitedstates  A notable republican stronghold areahttpswwgooglecomsearchclientfirefoxbdqUS2020electionresults NEERs own wind turbine deployment map in the annual report p13 backs up that their expansion is largely in that area

I wouldnt be surprised at all if the Democrats quietly slated a lot of  the renewables spending into the midwest in an attempt to entrench a prounion and proclean energy vote there  forcing the republican platform into a weird spot in future elections It helps that thats pretty much the economical way to play it too

To sum it up I think NextEras going to be a serious beneficiary of the renewables bill however it ends up going down even if only because of their financial resources deployment experience and contracts with  suppliers A big portion of this is that I dont believe the market has  priced in the amount theyre collecting directly and indirectly because  the response so far seems to have been FANTANICLNQCLN goes brr

Lets talk about the competition The other US utility companies that were  listed as leaders in the clean energy transition by Global Platts are  Dominion Energy Sempra Energy and Xcel Energy From one look at them  it seems like theyre 1 much smaller and 2 at best half off on PE  so I didnt really look at them too hard if Im being honest

Now for the bigger question Do I grab NEE or clean energy ETF of choice  Really its up to you I think that the clean energy ETFs are trading  at downright idiotic valuations now That and Id much rather bet on  one or two known strong performers that I believe in than I would on a  bunch of companies picked by someone else That being said those ETFs  have much more hype behind them which is an important consideration in  this market

Shortterm catalysts  are basically the stimulus bill and earnings on the 26th I expect some  big announcements on how they plan to capitalize on the bill during the  earnings call and a huge bump in interest if they announce that theyre  accelerating their renewables pipeline and focusing on that portion of  the company more

Anyways onto positions and how Id trade it

 If  you just want to buy and hold in an account for the extreme longterm   buy shares and hold I think this is going to heavily outperform  the SP 500 into the future
 If  you want to get some of the spicy synthetic leverage gains with me   Jan 20 2023 80cs They print if the stock goes up 15 in the  next 2 years because IV is super low I grabbed 10 at 1210 at the start  of the week on the dip but I think theyll open 1300 tomorrow Keep  in mind that you dont need to hold till expiry Ill probably liquidate  these after a year because I want the tax benefits

Who knows what the next 10 20 or even 50 years will bring  I dont know but im certain that change is here to stay so stop worrying and embrace the unknown

While I do agree with you in the fact that some of these company valuations are insane and this bull market cannot be seen as sustainable in the short run I think its important to weigh those concerns with the macroeconomic factors that have changed the investment landscape in the last 1020 years  You should have a healthy dose of skepticism otherwise you will be caught off guard but you should also take into account the investing world is evolving and traditional metrics and guidelines in which investors have traditionally based their investment decisions on needs to adapt with it  What remains true is that not all great things can last forever and a healthy correction is brewing in the future and trying to time it is and always will be the worst mistake you can make  DCA into your positions has and always will be no matter what the best way to invest

Who knows what the investment landscape will look like in 1050 years  Creative destruction in our world knows no bounds and we are constantly advancing toward it  Change is brought on by optimism and in a 2020 lacking that  heres to a forward looking future built on the backs of bulls



Edit 1  Been getting a lot of traction and appreciation as well as hate for this post so I want to clarify a few things about what im tryna say here

1  I am not saying invest heavy into TechnologyClean energy or any of the other crazy shit thats been popping cause it will stay that way  I am saying that look at what technology and advancements we have made just in the last 1020 years as a global population and tried to tie it to financial advancements related to technology  What will the next 50 years bring  I dont know but im excited to find out
2 I am aware that we are in uncharted waters here as a country and there are a lot of risks regarding the economy right now  Youd be an idiot to think that there are not going to be consequences for the amount of money printing weve been doing  The M1 money supply just shot up this last year and if we hit inflation we could be in trouble  Invest smart look for value average in dont buy into the hypeFOMO youll be setting yourself up for some losses
3 My post is geared to a lot of the newer investors that are coming into this space trying to figure out what the fuck to do with their money  A lot of them are scared about what could happen with the economic factors right now  I am saying that look at us as a whole in a broader sense of the market  look what we have done in the past 1020 years as a nation and as a global population  Its fucking exciting and that innovation and drive for the next generation future will never stop  Think long term always as a new investors youre young and can handle losses  I saw a comment on another thread saying take your initial losses as tuition in learning how to invest and that is the mindset of a winner in the long run  Investment in yourself and making your dollar work for you is building that future and its exciting
4 Stop calling me stupidnaive it hurts my feelings lol  Im a youngin who wants all this 2020 fear and negativity to stop and I want my fellow youngins to join me in building a better future

Cheers

The administration is forced to either blatantly ignore the courts in the most globally publicly recognizable way possible or capitulate and lose what leverage and respect they thought they had with every country on the planet

They pissed off every country in the world and spat all over them at every possible occasion And the House burned all of its political capital to squeeze by a disaster of a bill The only way they could tell everyone it was going to be paid for was by tariffs and cuts Tariffs just got taken out 

The funny part is it doesnt really matter what they do  ie attempt to ignore it or get a stay and tie it up in the courts or comply no way thats not their style but its not impossible  in any case its moot The signal has been sent the king has been shown to bleed 

Stocks may rip but I think it will be shortlived Id be more willing to say bonds crash as lenders realize this will get tied up in the courts and scare off any chance of the Senate passing it in the aftermath of this disaster Its DOA Thats not even considering the astronomical domestic business pressure theyre already certainly feeling as businesses across the country now have a legal decision to exempt them from anything the administration tries to do now Its weak but enough of a safe bet to plan around for a business leader owner operator to make decisions

As for the geopolitical situation Id imagine there are a good number of reasons for the world to feel the bully who threatened so much to so many shouldnt be made to atone for its hubris Supply chains have been dramatically disrupted and reoriented and our debt and dollar depend on the world we disrespected and threatened feeling that we are trustworthy debtors and agreeable partners The domestic factors already mentioned strongly suggest both of these tenets have been violated in scarring and long lasting ways Enough of the world has started to meaningfully question American exceptionalism and to put or rather begin moving their money where their mouth is  demanding higher yields on Treasuries the Taiwanese dollar spike foreign currency and equity market record appreciation you get the idea This gives them the signal they need to begin offloading our debt based on the same risk assessment that domestic businesses are playing Theres no way for them to fund this now and everyone now knows it cant be furnished by force from anywhere except inside the country itself Our debt crisis is now an actual crisis

1 Business Model

What does Loop do

Loop designs manufactures sells and services hydrogen fuel cell systems for the electrification of commercial vehicles Its nearterm focus markets include lightmedium trucks eg home delivery vehicles semitrucks buses and other commercial vehicles mining etc with longterm plans to expand into other intermodal transport marine rail etc

What is its product offering

Loops key products are fuel cell stacks stacks of fuel cells that produce electricity and water when supplied with hydrogen and oxygen and fuel cell modules fuel cell stacks along with the balance of plant  all the necessary equipment to operate and has manufacturing facilities in British Columbia Canada and Langfang China Loop believes that through its proprietary eFlow technology its fuel cell systems are superior to its peers in terms of fuel efficiency durability and power  We expect these characteristics to be key differentiators as Loop and its competitors race to secure OEM relationships and achieve massmarket adoption

Understanding the current landscape and Loops competitive advantages

On the path to transitioning the global fleet to zeroemissions vehicles Loop sees the current lithiumion batteries as only a part of the solution with its hydrogen fuel cells creating significant advantages over the existing solutions in terms of range payload and refueling times Loop markets three key benefits to its fuel cells compared to competitors which we think wellposition the company to continue to lead its industry In addition to the technical competitive advantages which are outlined in the Competitive Landscape section we see Loops industry positioning is supported by Cummins investment and its partnership with OEMs

Growth Strategy

The company has rapidly developed its business development pipeline forming partnerships with OEMs and building a relatively small revenue backlog of 164 million to date with plans of significantly expanding this over time The company expects that the larger OEM suppliers will be in a position to launch commercial vehicles with fuel cell systems between 2025 and 2027 meaning the companys nearterm focus should be on manufacturing fuel cell vessels in smaller volumes and developing its technology and backlog Loop also has a JV with InPower in China to establish a manufacturing line We think Loops stated strategy below is wellaligned with the most important objective  becoming the dominant player in the industry

Loop Growth Strategy

1 Focus on commercial vehicle market and leverage products into other markets
2 Scale manufacturing and customer support infrastructure
3 Develop partnerships with leading OEMs and OEM suppliers
4 Reduce costs by leveraging scale and internalizing certain components
5 Continue to invest to develop and improve eFlow technology

2 Management Board and Ownership Overview

Loops management team is highly experienced with significant experience in related industries including fuel cell development and automotive development key relationships at strategically important OEMs The company also appointed two special advisors with excellent track records leading companies Lord John Browne BP Riverstone and Lance Uggla IHS Market SP Global With its recent additions we view Loops management team and board as a strength

The current and pro forma ownership of the company is included below Upon completion of the offering there will be a concurrent reverse stock split consolidating 3 shares into 1 share which is noted below along with the forced conversion of convertible debentures reflected in the table below

3 Market Overview  Competitive Landscape

Industry Overview

The market for fuel cell electric vehicles is expected to grow at a 39 CAGR from 26bn today to 508bn Hydrogen fuel cells are the most widely adopted form with significant investments from governments and corporates to support the widespread adoption of hydrogen The hydrogen market is expected to represent 10 trillion with countries representing 70 of the worlds GDP introducing hydrogen strategies including US and Russia  While this is clearly a growing attractive and strategic market we do note that many industry data sources provided by management are sponsored research including the Hydrogen Council

We see electrification as an important global trend as countries and companies commit to decreasing emissions with a target of netzero by 2050

Loops competitors include Ballard Power Beijing Sinohytec Horizon Fuel Technologies Hydrogenics Corporation Hyundai Nuvera Fuel Cells Plug Power Powercell and Toyota Despite this strong group of competitors Loops technology provides significant competitive advantages noting that competitors pose a significant risk for the company see Key Risks to Loops Valuation

Competitive Advantages per Loop

 Fuel Efficiency  efficiency improvements enable greater savings and higher return on investment
   According to Loop the incorporation of fuel cells into battery electric vehicles increases range by 25 to 3 times
   16 lower fuel consumption vs competitors generating 300k in fuel savings over lifetime
 Higher Peaking Power  provides higher payload capacity and range
   50 more peak power than top competitor and 90 more peak power than most competitors
 Durability  results in lower service and maintenance costs
   Up to 10x better current density uniformity

4 IPO Details

Overview of the Offering

Loop issued its preliminary prospectus on February 5 2021 announcing plans to raise 100mn 15 greenshoe option at an 1216share valuation Shares are expected to price the week of February 15 2021 and trade the week of February 22 2021 The IPO will be led by National Bank Financial Per filings the net proceeds are expected to be used for RD capital assets and other expenses

Funds from the strategic financing will be used to further accelerate the companys product development activities project deployments and growth plans as it expands its technical leadership in medium and heavyduty hydrogen fuel cell bus and trucking applications

Share Count

Loops current fullydiluted share count preIPO is 300 million shares and pro forma for the offering will increase to 396 million shares assuming shares price at the top range of indications and the underwriters exercise their overallotment option

Previous Equity Raises

Based on Cummins prior investments in the company and current shares owned Cummins cost basis is 432share

5 Financial Analysis

Revenue was 350k for the three and nine months ended September 30 2020 primarily representing the sale of demo field and test bench units This will increase as the business continues to develop its product backlog noting Loops definition of this figure represents estimated sales including conditional agreements and MOUs We view the development of this product backlog and execution to be a key risk as this backlog may or may not actually materialize

Product Backlog as of January 31 2021 represents revenue of 164mn up from 43mn as of December 31 2020

Operating Expenses  the company expects to achieve gross margins of 30 and EBIT margins of 20 by 2030 supported by its eFlow technology which the company expects to reduce manufacturing costs We think that Loops approach to design inhouse and expand vertically along the supply chain will be beneficial to achieve bestinclass margins Given the significant size of the addressable market economies of scale and importance of reaching the tipping point for massmarket adoption we expect significant MA in the nearterm We also expect strategic MA to be viewed favourably by the market with the understanding that despite nearterm dilution these types of transactions should be accretive to longterm value

Capital Structure  pro forma for the offering Loops balance sheet will substantially change with the majority of its debt convertible debentures converting into shares leaving Loop with an essentially debtfree balance sheet

6 Valuation  Key Risks

Market Valuation

We expect shares to price at the top range of the 16share IPO price valuing the company on a fullydiluted basis at 513mn At this valuation we see tremendous longterm upside if the business is able to execute on its plan see multiples valuation below

Market Cap mn6336
 Net Debt1205
Enterprise Value5131

Multiples Valuation

While it is difficult to value the business today we and Loop expect the fuel cell market for commercial vehicles to significantly expand in the next few years with OEMs ramping up production for commercial launch by 2026 The market for fuel cell electric vehicles is expected to grow to 7bn in 2026

Working backwards from this if Loop grows to a 750mn revenue business with 20 EBIT margins 2026 EBIT of 150mn and a 15x EBIT valuation in line with current valuation multiples this would imply a 22bn enterprise value in 2026 Discounting this back to today at a 15 cost of equity still results in 11bn of value offering 2x upside We also think this 15x multiple is conservative given the growth potential of the industry and potential for Loop to become a leading market player

Using this same methodology 2026E revenue of 200mn  400mn at a 15x EBIT multiple backs into the 1216share range today

Key Risks to Loops Valuation

 Inability to grow business development pipeline with OEMs or translate pipeline into revenuegenerating contracts
   The current pipeline represents 164mn which includes conditional agreements and MOUs the key focus of the business is expanding on this pipeline
 Existing and new competitors developing a more attractive more widely adopted product offering
   While Loops positioning is protected by patents technological advantages and Cummins backing OEMs with substantially more capital and may enter the space and compete
 Technological risk of more attractive technology rendering Loops technology and offering obsolete
   Emissions technology continues to advance and there may be a new form of technology that will reach massmarket adoption replacing hydrogen fuel cells
 Largescale manufacturing execution
   While Loops management team has experience building out manufacturing the company and its competitors have yet to execute on the largescale manufacturing required to meet expected future demand

170,170,1662535603.0,"Porsche IPO is so corrupt that if it goes through, I’m never investing into German stocks again","TLDR the Porsche family is getting full control of Porsche the company literally for free This is the main reason for the IPO The way the IPO is structured will hurt VW and gullible investors buying into this VW and its longterm strategy are thrown into disarray

TLDR with light details

1 The Porsche family already owns a significant chunk of both VW and Porsche companies But they want full control of the Porsche company
2 They ousted the CEO of VW on a pretext and forced the IPO that benefits only them
3 The family will get additional 25 of the Porsche which will give them full control of the company
4 The family is not paying a market price for 25 stake In fact they are not paying at all because they forced VW to pay a dividend from the IPO proceeds which the family will get by being a shareholder of VW
5 Shares available to the public during the IPO are all nonvoting

Long story

The way the IPO is organized is a disgrace and if the German government allows it to go through as is I will have no faith in making longterm investments in German stocks anymore

If this is legal under German laws then Im not buying If this is illegal and they dont do anything Im not buying either

To understand what and why is happening you need a little context so here it is

The Porsche family lost control of the Porsche company during the 2008 financial crisis They wanted to buy VW but ended up in a weird financial situation where they instead had to give up control of Porsche to VW but got a controlling voting stake in VW

The ownership structure is complicated but in a simplified form it looks like this

The family  Porsche Holdings  VW company  Porsche company

The IPO will make it look like this

The family  Porsche Holdings  VW company 50 of voting rights  
  
The family  Porsche Holdings  Porsche Company 50 of voting rights

The money flow is like this

The family buys 25 of voting shares from VW below market price with no competition  
  
VW pays 50 of IPO proceeds as dividends  
  
The family gets its money back from VW in the form of dividends

This IPO would be a disaster even during normal times VW is losing its best cash cow for half the price and the price is below market rate But its happening during one of the worst times for IPOs ever The stocks are in a global downturn hammered by inflation rising rates quantitative tightening supply chain issues and ongoing war in Ukraine which amplified all of the above and added energy crisis on top of that Germany is in the worst economic situation since the fall of the Berlin wall

This is not the right time to IPO a luxurious brand However this is the best time for the family to get their favorite asset out of VW From their perspective the less money IPO makes the better This conflict of interests is as bad as it gets

IPO shares available to the public will be useless nonvoting shares for gullible investors who do not understand what they are buying Think SNAP or GOOG But it gets worse

Lets remember for a moment that VW was not a good company for a long while It ended up in a diesel gate scandal had to pay enormous fines as well as to change its CEO This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because VW got a good new CEO had to reinvent itself by becoming more environmentally friendly and thus started an early transition into EVs

VW is already a top seller of EVs in Europe and rapidly growing its market share It has a vast portfolio of cars ranging all segments from the cheapest economy cars to the most luxurious ones of which Porsche is the main brand Platforms within VW are interchangeable they use the same tech across multiple brands to achieve synergy

Now if you take Porsche out these plans are thrown into disarray On top of that both Porsche and VW will have the same CEO answering to the same family Which company do you think he will prioritize more when it comes to that

Whats more the transition to EVs was not going smooth already There are issues with software which VW was never good at historically And the labor unions were very unhappy at the potential loss of jobs because you need less jobs to make EVs The family seized on this opportunity to oust the CEO under a pretext that the software was delayed and the labor unions supported the change to get their job guarantees

The labor unions now expect to keep their jobs meaning VW will have to keep combustion engine factories operating for longer for no economical reason This is good for workers but a disaster for investors in VW The family got their IPO which is good for them but also a disaster for investors And the new CEO has no experience in building software whatsoever with no sound plans to address the problems

During 20012003 while the overall equity markets were down each of the three years there was still money to be made in commodities fixed income and precious metals

In 2008 which is the worst market of all our lifetimes one could make money in alternatives fixed income especially taxable income and healthcare

Even in 197374 there was money to be made in TBills TBonds and real estate

This year has been different There is money to be made in commodities especially with energy  The only other sector that has been profitable is agriculture  What seems to make this different is that the more traditional hedges against down markets such as fixed income and precious metals have been losers too The last time we had a market that was down over 20 and the treasury bond index was negative was in 1931 It appears we are in new territory for many of us including professionals This is function of rising interest rates from historical lows and an uncertain future for the global economy  Based on inflationary numbers every country on this planet is feeling it

So how does it make any sense that their market cap is roughly HALF of their annual revenue

Compare that to TSLA at about 35x the revenue multiple In the same industry SPWR is at 5x the revenue multiple Chinese electric car manufacturer NIO its also trading at around 5x the revenue multiple and its not profitable

174,174,1732837477.0,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didnt know that I thought was common knowledge but Im curious how common it actually is or if its a generational gap

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms eg video games CGI rendering etc and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation large matrix multiplication They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing  other stuff but through no effort on their own the other stuff is now more valuable than the graphics processing Their AI hardware is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers to Pixar etc not similar they are literally the same thing

They didnt somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years thats better than everybody elses theyve been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case This is also why its so hard for a competitor to overtake them they have a lot of ground to catch up on Hardware development is really slow really expensive and really difficult

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an exNvidia currentTesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia which is not really even remotely likely IMHO Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then theyre only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally

As to why Nvidia and not AMD its largely because of their software stack and community support They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA cuDNN etc and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10 years ago so now its what everybody builds on

Before all the armchair experts come out of the woodwork yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost And I know that theyve been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML usecases eg tensorcores and theyre not exactly like GPUs of old And yes I know that their datacenter business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards

I dont mean to discount their good work theyve done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck

Key factors to consider

1 Policy Shifts  Government Support While governments have historically supported clean energy these policies are becoming increasingly uncertain The volatility surrounding subsidies tariffs and international agreements can significantly affect the outlook for renewable energy investments
2 Supply Chain and Production Challenges The sector is grappling with major supply chain disruptions particularly in the production of solar panels and wind turbines These bottlenecks are pushing up costs and causing delays which are impacting the profitability of many companies
3 Market Volatility The renewable energy sector has not seen the consistent growth many had anticipated External factors such as rising interest rates inflation and a challenging global economy have contributed to the sectors struggles leaving many investors uncertain about future returns

That said some companies remain strong players in the space View Holdings offers a portfolio of companies that are still actively engaged in renewable energy

 First Solar Inc  A leader in solar technology focused on sustainable energy solutions
 Iberdrola SA  A Spanish utility firm investing heavily in renewable energy
 SSE Plc  A key UK utility with a focus on offshore wind projects
 Enphase Energy Inc  Known for its solar microinverters and energy management systems
 China Yangtze Power Co  A utility company with significant renewable energy assets
 Vestas Wind Systems AS  One of the largest wind turbine manufacturers in the world
 Chubu Electric Power Co Inc  A Japanese utility focused on clean energy
 EDP Energias de Portugal SA  A major player in wind and solar energy in Europe
 Suzlon Energy Ltd  Indias leading renewable energy company
 Nextracker Inc  Specializes in solar tracking systems

Given the challenges faced by the sector do you believe renewable energy is still a solid investment or are the risks too high

190,190,1596113395.0,"U.S. second-quarter GDP plunged by a record 32.9%, vs 34.7% expected - CNBC","The US economy suffered its worst period ever in the second quarter with GDP falling 329
	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a decline of 347

The US economy saw the biggest plunge in activity it has ever known in the second quarter though it wasnt quite as bad as feared

Gross domestic product from April to June plunged 329 according to the Commerce Departments first reading on the data released Thursday Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a drop of 347

Still it was the worst drop ever with the closest previously coming in mid1921

Sharp contractions in personal consumption exports inventories investment and spending by state and local governments all converged to bring down GDP which is the combined tally of all goods and services produced during the period

Spending slid in health care and goods such as clothing and footwear Inventory investment drops were led by motor vehicle dealers while equipment spending and new family housing took hits when it came to investment

Prices for domestic purchases a key inflation indicator fell 15 for the period compared to a 14 increase in the first quarter when GDP fell 5 The personal consumption expenditures price index dropped 19 after rising a tepid 13 in Q1 Excluding food and energy the core PCE prices were off 11

However personal income soared thanks in large part to government transfer payments associated with the coronavorus pandemic Currentdollar personal income rose more than sixfold to 139 trillion while disposable personal income shot up 421 to 153 trillion

Despite the rise personal outlays tumbled by 157 trillion due in large part to a drop in services spending

Not the Great Depression nor the Great Recession nor any of the more than three dozen economic slumps over the past two centuries have ever caused such a sharp drain over so short a period of time

By comparison the worst quarter during the financial crisis of 2008 was the 84 GDP drop in the fourth quarter of that year The previous lowwater mark was a 10 slide in the first quarter of 1958 while the worst in recorded history came in Q2 of 1921

This particular tumble in activity owes to a different source than any of its predecessors a governmentinduced shutdown aimed at combating Covid19

Workers across the country were told to stay home from any job not considered essential resulting in a crushing halt that saw the unemployment rate peak at 147 a postDepression high The National Bureau of Economic Research said the current recession actually started in February a month before the pandemic declaration Firstquarter GDP fell 5",Reddit,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8624158, 'word': 'US', 'start': 4, 'end': 6}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9947288, 'word': 'GDP', 'start': 73, 'end': 76}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9974489, 'word': 'Dow Jones', 'start': 113, 'end': 122}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90937716, 'word': 'US', 'start': 162, 'end': 164}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9976288, 'word': 'Dow Jones', 'start': 447, 'end': 456}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8225651, 'word': 'GDP', 'start': 719, 'end': 722}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9867518, 'word': 'GDP', 'start': 1152, 'end': 1155}]",0,-0.9881

However Energy transition sources grow only 04 per  year Turns out I cant post URLs so dont know how to cite this

Theres also the real possibility that greenenergy is energynegative Meaning it takes more energy to mine the copper the steel the materials that go into producing green energy than energy it returns

Even oil is mostly energy negative the last energy positive well was discovered in 1970s if I remember correctly

Therefore it has been my suspicion that at first the Energy Transition was really a way of creating batteries to save as much energy as we could with the technology at the time in order to stave off an energy crisis Imagine if you will taking an X amount of energy and then using it to build an energy producing product at 09X That decay is much slower than simply burning it out of a tail pipe

Regardless of the case even extremeWoke BP has thrown in the towel and entirely abandoned the Energy Transition mantraagain

 Conclusion

Proterra is not only the most undervalued stock on the entire market its also positioned to be one of the best performing companies over the next several years With an incredible firstmover advantage 16mm driven10 years production and a massive lead on the market 50 US market share there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding postmerger which is expected to happen end of Marchfirst week in April although the official statement is the first half of this year 

The company is currently undervalued by 11642 on fundamentals alone and thats on the fair end When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher I see a TSLA situation brewing No not because its just another EV company because its an established wellconnected constantly growing commercial EV company

Bear Case I literally cant think of one aside from the merger falling apart If someone could provide a bear case in the comments for Proterra assuming the merger is successful I would love to discuss it because either Im missing something glaringly obvious or this might be my greatest pick

How to Play

I am long on this with my shares I will be holding all my shares for several years my calls I will exercise half after the merger and sell the rest for a nice profit If you want to just play the merger thats an option too Meaning just hold until the merger date and sell at whatever you think the peak is that very day

1 Buy shares ACTC will change to PTRA after the merger Shares will be 11
2 Warrants ACTCW if youre not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of 1150
3 Calls I think virtually anything listed is going to print aside from 0319
4 Selling puts the premiums are hefty so either youll get a nice premium or youll own some shares at a really nice discount

6C 0820 35

TLDR Fundamentals alone show this company is already 11642 undervalued factor in hype forwardthinking IPO etc and I cant even come up with a PT I would expect a PT postmerger to travel upwards to 5060 and settle back down no lower than 34 EOY my prediction is 7080 2025 prediction is 300500 I recommend you read I wouldnt want to gloss this one over if I were you If you prefer you could simply check out their investor presentationhttpswwproterracomwpcontentuploads202101ACTCProterraInvestorPresentationpdf 

EDIT The 103 factor is from an EV basket that includes many direct and indirect competitors The list is in the presentation 

EDIT 2 This is a fundamental DD There are a lot of comments regarding other competitors not mentioned Most of the companies not mentioned were including in the 103 factor for diversity A lot of these competitors being mentioned are bus manufacturers Proterra is a fleet level ecosystem infrastructure provider They dont just make buses 

EDIT 3 Fair warning even though Proterra is significantly undervalued there are other market mechanics at play With the NASDAQ sell off its uncertain how much lower ACTC will go if at all I think this is an excellent play now you just need excellent timing
